# CE Credits & Learning Outcomes Alignment
Program Design, Speakers & Content

Document title: CE Credits & Learning Outcomes Alignment  
Document description: Maps sessions to accreditation requirements, learning objectives, and attendance tracking for continuing education. Format: alignment matrix and compliance checklist.

---

## Overview

This document is a practical, end-to-end guide to design program content that earns Continuing Education (CE) credit, align sessions to measurable learning outcomes, and capture attendance accurately for compliance and audit. It includes:

- A planning workflow and timeline
- An alignment matrix mapping sessions to objectives and accreditation requirements
- Attendance and credit calculation rules
- Roles and responsibilities
- Compliance checklists
- Ready-to-use templates

Example scenario: 1-day, in-person Healthcare Quality Improvement Summit on November 14, 2025, offering AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s) for physicians, ANCC contact hours for nurses, and ACHE Qualified Education for administrators. Adjust credit types as needed for your field (e.g., SHRM/HRCI, PMI PDUs, IACET CEUs, APA, ACPE).

---

## Key Definitions and Rules

- CE Credit units:
  - AMA PRA Category 1 Credit: 1 credit = 60 minutes of accredited learning
  - ANCC Contact Hour: 1 contact hour = 60 minutes
  - ACHE Qualified Education: typically 1 credit = 60 minutes
  - IACET CEU: 1.0 CEU = 10 contact hours (600 minutes)
- Creditable time excludes:
  - Meals with no educational content
  - Exhibits/sponsor presentations unless accredited and independent
  - Breaks and transition periods
- Rounding conventions (confirm with your accreditor):
  - AMA/ANCC: round to the nearest quarter hour; no credit for segments under 15 minutes
- Partial credit:
  - Allowed if attendance time in a session meets minimum thresholds and learning evaluation is completed (policy-defined; commonly 75–90% attendance per session)
- Required elements for accredited sessions:
  - Needs assessment and gap statement
  - Learning objectives (SMART; Bloom’s taxonomy-aligned)
  - Independence from commercial interests; conflict of interest (COI) disclosure and mitigation
  - Evidence-based content with references
  - Evaluation and/or assessment (e.g., post-test, reflective statement)
  - Attendance tracking and record retention
  - Provider and accreditation statements in materials

---

## Risk Log and Mitigations

- Late COI disclosure: Set hard deadline; if missed, replace faculty or designate session non-credit.
- Commercial bias found in slides: Require revisions; conduct second-round review; document mitigation.
- Attendance tech failure: Activate paper sign-in; photograph room entry; use time-stamped QR codes; communicate to learners.
- Over-run sessions: Do not award credit beyond approved time; adjust emcee cues for timing.
- Incomplete evaluations: Send automated reminders at 7, 14, 21 days; clearly state certificate deadline.
