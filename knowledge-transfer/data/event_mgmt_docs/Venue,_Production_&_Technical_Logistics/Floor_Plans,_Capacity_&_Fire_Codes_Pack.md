# Floor Plans, Capacity & Fire Codes Pack
Document type: Venue, Production & Technical Logistics
Format: CAD (.dwg/.vwx) + annotated PDF set + capacity charts (PDF/Sheets)

## Overview
This pack consolidates scaled floor plans, layout options, occupant load calculations, egress routes, and fire/life-safety compliance notes for events. It is designed so production, operations, vendors, and authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) can clearly validate that layouts meet code and operational needs. This is a working and approval set: use it to plan seating, staging, exhibits, and circulation; to brief security and crowd managers; and to obtain AHJ sign-offs.

Scope covers:
- Ballroom, exhibit hall, meeting rooms, pre-function, back-of-house, and exterior queuing areas
- Seating layouts: theater, classroom, banquet, cocktail/standing, exhibit booths
- Temporary structures: stages, camera platforms, risers, scenic walls, drape
- Egress and life-safety: exits, aisle geometry, exit signage, extinguishers, fire watch
- Accessibility (ADA): wheelchair spaces, companion seating, accessible routes
- Production overlays: rigging loads, ceiling heights, utilities, cable routing, restricted zones

Use with: Event Production Plan, Security Plan, Rigging Plot, Power Plan, and Vendor Method Statements.

## Key Details and Steps
1) Gather base data (Weeks -6 to -5)
- Request current CAD from venue (architectural floor plans, reflected ceiling plan, MEP life-safety layers).
- Obtain fire/life-safety systems data: sprinklered? alarm panel zones? extinguisher specs?
- Confirm local codes with AHJ: IBC/IFC edition, NFPA 101 adoption, local amendments, crowd manager requirements.

2) Verify dimensions (Week -5)
- Conduct site walk with laser measure for critical spans, door clear widths, and ceiling heights.
- Validate exit door leaf widths and counts, operability, and hardware (panic bars).

3) Define program and blocking (Week -5)
- Confirm event agenda, room functions, stage sizes, VIP aisles, camera positions, F&B points, special effects.

4) Draft layouts and compute capacities (Week -4)
- Lay out seating and furnishings per setup option (theater/classroom/banquet/exhibit).
- Calculate occupant load per space and per setup using adopted load factors.
- Compute required egress width and exit count; check travel distances and dead ends.
- Add ADA seating and routes; identify platform lifts/ramps where needed.

5) Add life-safety, production, and utility overlays (Week -4)
- Show exits, aisles, fire extinguisher locations, exit signage, and crowd manager posts.
- Overlay stages/risers, FOH mix, barricades, cable runs, power drops, and rigging points.

6) Internal review and AHJ consult (Week -3)
- Bluebeam session with Production, Ops, Security, Venue, and Fire Marshal (if available).
- Log AHJ comments; revise layouts and capacities accordingly.

7) Issue for approval (Week -2)
- Stamp sheets with “Issued for AHJ Review.” Include code summary and calculations.
- Respond to AHJ comments; document deviations/mitigations (e.g., fire watch, reduced capacity).

8) Final issue and distribution (Week -1)
- Stamp “Approved for Implementation.” Freeze capacities and layouts; add revision cloud/triangle notes.
- Post final PDFs in project drive; notify all vendors. Print occupant load signs and aisle markers.

9) On-site verification (Event week)

## Example Capacity Chart (excerpt)
Confirm with final AHJ calculations. Egress may cap below calculated occupant load.

- Ballroom A (120 ft x 80 ft; 9,600 sq ft; sprinklered)
  - Theater (7 net): 1,371 persons
  - Banquet rounds (15 net): 640 persons
  - Standing (5 net): 1,920 persons
  - Available exit width: 3 double doors x 64 in clear = 192 in
    - Egress capacity: 192 in / 0.15 = 1,280 persons
  - Posted max capacities:
    - Theater: 1,280 (egress-limited)
    - Banquet: 640 (load-factor-limited)
    - Standing: 1,280 (egress-limited)
  - Notes: Provide 2 accessible wheelchair platforms each side of center aisle; cross-aisle at mid-depth 8 ft wide.

- Exhibit Hall (200 ft x 300 ft; 60,000 sq ft; sprinklered)
  - Standing (5 net): 12,000 persons (preliminary)
  - Egress: 10 double exits x 64 in = 640 in → 640/0.15 = 4,267 persons
  - Posted operational cap: 4,200 persons (round down and allow for service corridors and obstructions)
  - Notes: Maintain 12-ft main aisles; 4-ft booth-to-booth aisles; 8-ft service corridors at perimeter.

- Meeting Room 1 (60 ft x 40 ft; 2,400 sq ft; sprinklered)
  - Theater: 342 persons (load-factor-limited)
  - Classroom (approx 20 net incl. tables/aisles): 120 persons
  - Banquet rounds: 160 persons
  - Egress: 2 exits (one double, one single): 64 + 32 = 96 in → 96/0.15 = 640 persons (not limiting)
  - Notes: Minimum two 44-in aisles; 1:12 ramp to 24-in stage.

Capacity sheets list all rooms with per-setup maxima and the limiting factor (egress vs. load factor vs. aisle geometry).

## Aisle and Seating Geometry (implementation rules)
- Aisle widths: 44 inches minimum; increase where aisles converge; no encroachments (camera tripods, speaker stands).
- Row-to-row clearances:
  - Theater chairs: minimum 12 inches; recommend 18 inches (increase with more than 14 seats between aisles).
  - Maximum seats between aisles: 7 each side (14 total) unless wider aisles and increased row spacing per code.
- Cross-aisles: Provide at least one 6–8 ft cross-aisle for rooms over 500 seats; align with exits.
- ADA seating:
  - Distribution across price tiers and sightlines.
  - Companion seats adjacent; removable aisle seats with folding/removable armrests labeled with ADA icon.

## Staging, Rigging, and Utilities (coordination items)
- Stages/risers:
  - Typical live load: 125 psf minimum; submit structural data for temporary platforms >30 in high.
  - Two means of egress from stage if height >30 in or occupant load >50.
  - Under-stage storage prohibited unless fire-protected and approved.
- Rigging:
  - Verify venue rigging plot; typical WLL of points = 1,000–2,000 lb; factor of safety ≥ 8:1 for overhead lifting.
  - Show trim heights, point loads, bridles, and no-fly zones; PE stamp as required for nonstandard loads.
- Power:
  - Company switches: e.g., Ballroom A: (2) x 400A 120/208V 3Ø cam-lock; Exhibit Hall: (4) x 400A.
  - Cable management: ramp crossings in egress paths; no cables through doorways serving as the only exit.
  - Emergency power: identify circuits supporting exit signage, egress lighting, PA/voice evac.
- Drape/scenic:
  - All soft goods IFR; keep 18 in from sprinklers; no covering of strobes/detectors.
  - Scenic walls anchored and ballasted; provide engineer letter for walls >8 ft tall.

## Signage and Postings
- Occupant load signage: conspicuously posted at each room entrance matching approved capacities.
- Exit signage: internally illuminated/photoluminescent per venue standard; add temporary directional signs for re-routed exits.
- Aisle markers: alpha-numeric row/section markers for assemblies >500 seats; visible under show lighting.
- Prohibited/No storage signage: back-of-house and egress path reminders.

## Crowd Management and Operations
- Staffing: 1 crowd manager per 250 occupants; position at cross-aisles, exits, and choke points.
- Queuing: stanchions shown on FP-301; maintain 8 ft min clear between queue and exits; exterior queues on EX-801.

## Practical Notes and Common Pitfalls
- Don’t overcount seats: subtract camera platforms, ADA cutouts, tech tables, and sightline kills near screens.
- Aisles drift during setup: stake and string or tape aisles before chair drop; verify widths with a measuring wheel.
- Exit “borrowing”: exits discharging through adjacent spaces require those spaces to remain free/available—coordinate shared capacities with venue.
- Queue creep: build generous prefunction queues and dedicate lanes; protect exits with hard barricades if necessary.
- Last-minute F&B: buffets and bars often appear in egress paths—pre-approve fixed locations on FP-301 and mark “No F&B” zones.

## Disclaimers
- This pack is for event implementation and AHJ review; it does not replace the role of an architect or engineer of record where required. Temporary structures above code thresholds may require PE-stamped drawings and permits. Final authority rests with the AHJ and venue life-safety policies.
