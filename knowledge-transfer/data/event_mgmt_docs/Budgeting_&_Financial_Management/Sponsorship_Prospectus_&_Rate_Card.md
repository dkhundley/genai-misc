Last updated: 2025-08-23

Purpose: Enable any team member to build, price, and sell a sponsorship program using a clear valuation model, a sales deck, and a one-page rate card. This document covers structure, example content, financial logic, responsibilities, and workflows.

Scope: Applies to in-person conferences with a digital companion experience. Example below uses a hypothetical event to make the guidance concrete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

Deliverables
- Sales deck (15–20 slides) used by AE/BDR in outreach and live calls.
- One-page rate card (PDF) summarizing packages, add-ons, pricing, and terms.
- Back-end valuation workbook and inventory tracker (for finance and operations, not shared with sponsors).

Example event context (for realism)
- Event: FutureOps Summit 2026
- Dates/Location: May 12–14, 2026, Austin Convention Center + virtual stream
- Audience size: 2,200 in-person; 3,800 virtual
- Personas: VP/Director of Engineering, SRE/DevOps, Platform, FinOps, SecOps, IT Procurement
- Sponsor categories: Cloud/Infra, Observability, Security, Dev Tools, FinOps, AIOps, Training, Recruiting, Hardware

Revenue & margin targets
- Sponsorship revenue target: $850,000
- Package gross margin target: 70% blended
- Inventory sell-through target by T-60: 80% for core tiers; 60% for premium add-ons
- Cash flow target: 60% of committed cash received by T-90

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Details and Steps

1) Define program objectives and constraints
- Objectives: revenue generation, category leadership, attendee experience quality, and measurable ROI for sponsors.
- Constraints: venue capacity (e.g., 60 expo booths), stage time (e.g., 4 keynotes), attendee communications limits (e.g., 10 sponsored emails), and brand guardrails.

2) Build the benefits inventory and hard costs
Create a master list with quantity, description, and COGS (cost of goods/services). Examples:
- Brand visibility
  - Onsite logo placement: mainstage screen loop (4 positions; COGS $0; production allocation $1,000)
  - Entrance unit banner: 2 units; COGS $2,500 per print/rigging
  - Lanyard branding: 1 exclusive; COGS $6,500 production
- Thought leadership
  - Sponsored breakout session: 24 total; COGS $450 per session room labor
  - Panel participation: 10 seats; COGS $0 incremental
  - Mainstage 10-min talk: 2 available; COGS $2,000 production value
- Demand generation
  - Expo booth 10x10 inline: 40 units; COGS $2,200 each (pipe/drape, power, labor)
  - Lead scanning licenses: 100; COGS $150 per license
  - Hosted Buyer meetings: 120 meetings; COGS $90 per meeting (concierge + room + refreshments)
- Digital amplifiers
  - Sponsored email: 10 sends; COGS $150 per send (ops)
  - Mobile app push: 8 units; COGS $0
  - Livestream lower third + verbal mention: 6; COGS $0
- Experience/F&B
  - Coffee break sponsorship: 4; COGS $14,000 each (based on $7/pp x 2,000)
  - Reception sponsorship: 1; COGS $75,000
- Data & reporting
  - Post-event MQL report with benchmarks; COGS $250 per sponsor allocation

3) Value the inventory (transparent logic)
- Impressions-based assets: estimate reach and apply CPM/CPA relative to market benchmarks.
  - Example: Sponsored email to 24,000 subscribers; 30% open; 2% CTR; 144 clicks. If comparable CPC = $8–12 and the perceived value of first-party clicks is higher, value at $1,750–$2,000 per send.
- Experience assets: cost-plus with scarcity premium (typically 2.5–4x COGS).
- Stage time: outcome-based pricing; value higher for mainstage due to scarcity and perceived endorsement (e.g., $18,000–$35,000 depending on time/day).
- Booths: base price at 3–4x fully loaded COGS, modulated by location and footfall.

4) Architect packages (tiers + add-ons)
- Keep tiers simple and defensible; protect mainstage and attendee communications as premium.
- Cap categories to preserve value (e.g., max 6 sponsors per product category).

5) Set pricing and discounts
- Early-bird: up to 10% off until T-180; 5% until T-120; no discounts after.
- Multi-year: 10–15% off year 2 if signed with year 1.
- Association/Startups: set aside startup pavilion at lower price point (e.g., $3,500).
- Agency commissions: if applicable, price is net-new; avoid double discounts.

6) Build the sales deck (slide outline)
- Slides 1–4: Event mission, who attends (roles, seniority, buying power), proof (past logos, testimonials).
- Slides 5–7: Audience data (industry mix, company size, job titles, geography, budgets).
- Slides 8–10: Sponsorship philosophy, inventory categories, success stories with metrics.
- Slides 11–14: Packages overview with visuals; featured add-ons; exclusivity and category caps.
- Slides 15–16: Timeline and next steps; deliverables checklist; legal/payment terms summary.
- Slides 17–18: Case studies; ROI reporting example pages.

7) Build the one-page rate card
Include: tier names, headline benefits, price points, key add-ons, deadlines, and terms. Keep to one page, PDF, 300 dpi, brand-compliant. See “Example Rate Card” below.

8) Approval workflow
- Finance signs off on COGS, prices, and cash terms.
- Legal reviews terms, data/privacy, cancellation, IP clauses.
- Ops confirms deliverability and capacity caps.
- Marketing approves brand use and messaging.
- Final PDF versions stored in Sales Enablement folder; version-lock with date.

9) Outreach plan and pipeline math
- Revenue target: $850,000
- Average deal size assumption: $25,000 (mix of Silver + add-ons)
- Required closed-won: ~34 deals
- Close rate target: 25%
- Qualified opportunities needed: ~136
- Meeting set rate from outreach: 20%
- Qualified top-of-funnel needed: ~680 accounts
- Prospect list: 1,500–2,000 contacts across 700–900 accounts in ICP categories.

Cadence

- Sequence: 4-touch email + 2 LinkedIn + 1 call over 14 business days; recycle with new content in 30 days.
- Anchor sponsors (Platinum/Gold) targeted first to set social proof.

10) Contracting and invoicing
- Order Form + MSA, executed DocuSign.
- Payment terms: 50% due on signature (non-refundable), 50% due net 30 and no later than T-30.
- Late fees: 1.5% per month past due. Services paused if balance unpaid at T-30.
- Taxes: note local tax treatment for sponsorship vs advertising vs F&B.
- Cancellations: 180+ days out, deposit forfeited; 179–91 days, 75% owed; 90 days or less, 100% owed.
- Make-goods: only for measurable delivery failures (e.g., email not sent). No make-goods for performance variance.

11) Fulfillment plan (post-sale)
- Sponsor onboarding call within 5 business days.
- Deliverables portal access (artwork specs, deadlines, asset uploads).
- Artwork deadlines: print assets T-35; app/email creative T-21; stage content T-28 draft, T-10 final.
- Onsite logistics kit: T-21; EAC orders and power due T-28; shipping window T-7 to T-3.
- Lead delivery SLA: onsite scans real-time; hosted buyer leads T+2; post-event full report T+10.

12) Reporting and ROI
- Provide: impressions delivered, scans, session attendance, meeting outcomes, CTRs, opt-in counts, benchmark comparisons.
- Sponsor NPS target: 60+
- Internal KPIs: package mix, gross margin by SKU, sell-through by asset, DSO (days sales outstanding), upsell rate.

Financial Model Snapshot (how to justify pricing)

Assumptions
- Booth COGS include basic power, labor, carpet/pipe-drape, security allocation.
- Stage assets include AV labor allocation and producer time.
- F&B priced at venue quotes + 25% service/fees.
- Marketing assets valued using comparable CPM/CPC and scarcity factors.

Targets
- Blended margin ≥ 70%
- Inventory revenue potential (at list price): ~$1.25M
- Breakeven on expo build and F&B even if only 55% of inventory sells (risk cushion)

Scenario guidance
- If early sales lag by T-150: bundle low-velocity assets (e.g., app push + banner) to protect core pricing.
- If sell-through exceeds 80% by T-120: implement 5–10% list price uplift on remaining inventory.

Practical Tips

- Price integrity: discount packages by adjusting add-ons, not core tier price when possible.
- Protect scarcity: stage time and attendee inbox are finite—tie them to premium tiers.
- Bundle thoughtfully: pair low-velocity digital assets with popular physical assets.
- Right-size for sponsor goals: if their KPI is meetings, steer to Hosted Buyer packs over stage time.
- Over-communicate deadlines: missed artwork creates cost overruns—automate reminders at T-35/T-21/T-14/T-7.
- Track COGS diligently: costs creep (AV, rigging, F&B) shrink margins; update workbook monthly.
- Renew early: schedule post-event ROI reviews within two weeks; propose multi-year with price protection.
