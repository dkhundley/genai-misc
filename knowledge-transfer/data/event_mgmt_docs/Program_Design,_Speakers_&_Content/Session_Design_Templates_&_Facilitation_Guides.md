## Overview

This document provides ready-to-use session design templates and facilitation guides for common session formats (keynote, panel, workshop, fireside chat, roundtable, and lightning talks). It includes learning objective frameworks, interactive methods, minute-by-minute timing, materials lists, accessibility guidance, and run-of-show (ROS) checklists.

Use this to:
- Design sessions that are outcomes-based, engaging, and consistent across your program.
- Prepare speakers and moderators with clear scripts, cues, and logistics.
- Coordinate roles across program, production, speakers, and volunteers.

- Gallery Walk: groups post outputs; others review and vote.

---

## Writing Strong Learning Objectives

- Use action verbs (analyze, apply, design, critique, implement).
- Make them specific and measurable.
- Keep 2–3 per session.

Examples:
- “Apply a 5-step rubric to evaluate vendor proposals.”
- “Design a 1-page roadmap using the provided template.”
- “Critique a data dashboard for bias using a checklist.”

---

## Accessibility & Inclusion Checklist

- Before
  - Offer captions and interpretation; confirm lead time.
  - Request speaker accessibility needs; share guidelines (mic usage, slide contrast).
  - Prepare large-print and digital handouts; ensure alt text for images.
- Room
  - Clear 36-inch aisles; reserved seating (front/mid/rear); stage ramp.
  - Adjustable microphone stands; seating with arms; quiet zone available.
- Content
  - Minimum 28pt font; high contrast; avoid color-only meaning; describe visuals.
  - Provide pronunciation for names; use inclusive examples.
- Delivery
  - One speaker at a time; always use a mic; repeat questions into mic.
  - Pace: 140–160 wpm; avoid reading slides verbatim.
- Hybrid/Virtual
  - Test captions; pin interpreter; monitor chat Q&A; provide dial-in and low-bandwidth options.

---

## Hybrid/Virtual Considerations

- Platform: Confirm meeting/webinar mode, attendee limits, breakout capabilities.

- Engagement: Use polls every 8–12 minutes; call on remote attendees first for Q&A.
- Backup: Local recording; backup internet (hotspot); upload slides in advance.

---

## Quality Standards & KPIs

- Design completeness: 100% of sessions have a completed Session Design Sheet.
- Timing: Sessions start and end within ±2 minutes of schedule.
- Engagement: ≥60% poll participation for sessions using polls.
- Accessibility: Captions functional in 100% of recorded sessions.
- Satisfaction: Average session rating ≥4.3/5; NPS ≥40.

---

## Risk Register (Common Issues & Mitigations)

- Speaker overruns timing → Use visible timer; pre-brief on timeboxes; moderator cut-ins.
- Tech failure (slides/polling) → Backup slides on USB; alternate activity in handbook.
- Low participation → Seed questions; use think–pair–share; incentivize via prize draw.
- Room overflow → Direct to overflow room/stream; close doors when full; signage.
- Accessibility lapse → Conduct pre-check with coordinator; maintain spare assistive devices.
