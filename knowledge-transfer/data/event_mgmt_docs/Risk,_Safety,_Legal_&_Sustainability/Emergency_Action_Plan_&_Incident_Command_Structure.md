## Fast Start – What To Do Now (First 10 Minutes)

- If you SEE FIRE/SMOKE or hear the fire alarm:
  - Pull nearest alarm pull station and call 911.
  - Evacuate via nearest safe exit; do not use elevators.
  - Direct others to exits and muster areas; assist persons with disabilities.
  - Report to your assigned Muster Area leader for accountability.

- If instructed to SHELTER-IN-PLACE (weather or hazmat):
  - Move to interior rooms/hallways on the lowest safe floor, away from glass.  
  - Close doors; silence phones; remain until “All Clear.”

- If ACTIVE THREAT is present:
  - Run, Hide, Fight (in that order), call 911 when safe.
  - Silence phones; do not open doors until law enforcement clears.

- Always follow the Incident Commander’s (IC) instructions via radio, PA, or mass notification.

## Evacuation Plan

Triggers  
- Fire alarm activation, visible smoke/fire, hazardous conditions, structural concerns, gas leak, directive from IC or public safety.

Key Steps  
1. Activate alarm (if not already sounding); call 911.  
2. Wardens sweep assigned zones, close doors (do not lock).  
3. Guide occupants to nearest safe exit; assist persons with disabilities using evacuation chairs (located Stairwells 1 and 3).  
4. Do not use elevators.  
5. Proceed to assigned muster areas and conduct headcount.  
6. Report status to Evacuation Group Supervisor; notify of missing persons and last known location.  
7. IC liaises with Fire Department; no re-entry until “All Clear.”

Primary Exits and Routes (example)  
- North Wing: Exits N1 and N2 to Oak Street sidewalks; use Route Blue.  
- South Wing: Exits S1 and S2 to Lot B; use Route Green.  
- Ballroom A/B: Exits BA1, BA2 to Lot C; use Route Red.  
- Loading Dock: Exit LD to Riverfront Path; use Route Yellow.

Muster Areas (with approximate coordinates)  
- Area A: Lot B NW Corner, near 3rd Street Gate (39.802101, -89.650990) – Capacity 600  
- Area B: Oak Street Median, north of Main Entrance (39.802680, -89.650220) – Capacity 400  
- Area C: Riverfront Park East Lawn (39.801510, -89.649510) – Capacity 300  
- Area D: Overflow – City Garage Roof Level 2 (39.802950, -89.651540) – Capacity 800

Accountability  
- Each team lead carries roster for staff/volunteers in their area.  
- Guests counted by clickers; estimate by section if time-critical.  
- Report: “Area A — 412 guests, 45 staff, 3 missing (names/roles), last seen [location/time].”

Time Targets  
- Alarm to evacuation start: under 60 seconds.  
- Full floor clearance: under 4 minutes (mobility assistance may extend).  
- Headcount report to IC: within 7 minutes of alarm.

Special Considerations  
- Mobility/Access: Assign two “buddies” per mobility-impaired person.  
- Children/Vulnerable Adults: Keep groups intact with chaperones.  
- Pyrotechnics/Hot Work: Cease immediately and isolate.  
- Animals: Service animals evacuate with handlers; event animals per handler plan.

## Shelter-in-Place Plan

Scenarios  
- Severe weather (tornado, straight-line winds, hail).  
- Airborne hazards (nearby chemical spill, smoke).  
- External violence or civil disturbance where evacuation is unsafe.

Key Steps  
1. IC announces Shelter-in-Place via PA/mass notification.  
2. Logistics/Utilities shuts HVAC (for hazmat) and secures windows/doors.  
3. Move occupants to pre-identified interior rooms/hallways:
   - Severe Weather Safe Rooms: Lower level interior corridors A and C; Rooms LL-12, LL-14 (no exterior glass).  
   - Hazmat Shelter: Conference Rooms 102–106 (few penetrations), door sweeps available in shelter bins.
4. Close doors; use door sweeps and tape for hazmat if needed.  
5. Maintain calm: provide updates every 10 minutes or when facts change.  
6. PIO coordinates accurate information (avoid rumors).  
7. IC issues “All Clear” after official confirmation (NWS, Fire Dept., PD).

Supplies in Shelter Bins  
- First aid kits, water, flashlights, spare radios, door sweeps, duct tape, gloves, blankets, sanitation bags, battery bank chargers.

- 30/30 Rule: Wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming.

Hail/Severe Thunderstorm  
- Protect occupants, move away from windows, shelter equipment, cover AV gear.

Extreme Heat  
- Establish cooling areas, provide water stations, enforce work/rest cycles, monitor for heat illness.

Snow/Ice
