  - Meet or exceed local EMS authority, occupational health, and public health regulations.
  - Prevent, detect, and manage infectious diseases and environmental health risks.
  - Minimize environmental impact of medical operations.
  - Protect privacy and meet data protection requirements.

- Scope:
  - Applies to pre-event planning through post-event reporting.
  - Covers indoor and outdoor venues.
  - Assumes up to 8,000 attendees/day (with scalable staffing grids).

- Key Outcomes:
  - Median medical response time ≤ 4 minutes; 90th percentile ≤ 7 minutes.
  - ≥ 85% of patients treated-and-released onsite.
  - Zero serious preventable adverse events.
  - Full compliance with incident reporting, notifiable disease reporting, and waste handling.

- Vomiting/diarrhea
- Rash with fever (concern for measles, varicella, mpox)
- Confirmed exposure to notifiable disease with symptoms

Flow Steps:
1) Identify and Mask: Provide surgical mask; maintain ≥ 6 ft distance during escort.
2) Escort to Isolation Room: Dedicated path; minimize public exposure.
3) Triage and History: Symptom onset, exposures, travel, vaccination status.
4) Clinical Assessment: Vitals (T, HR, RR, SpO2, BP). Determine acuity.
5) Point-of-care Testing (as available/authorized): e.g., COVID-19 antigen, glucose.
6) Management:
   - Mild: Symptomatic care, counseling, return-to-lodging instructions.
   - Moderate to severe or Red flags: EMS transport/hospital referral.
7) Documentation: Isolation Intake Form and Incident Report.
8) Notification: Medical Lead informs Public Health Liaison; report to local health authority if notifiable disease suspected.

ASCII Flow (simplified):
Entrance → Triage identifies symptoms → Mask + Escort → Isolation Room → Assess/Test → Manage → Discharge with instructions OR Transport → Clean/Disinfect → Restock

Privacy: Limit access; curtains/doors closed; records stored securely (HIPAA/GDPR compliant).
