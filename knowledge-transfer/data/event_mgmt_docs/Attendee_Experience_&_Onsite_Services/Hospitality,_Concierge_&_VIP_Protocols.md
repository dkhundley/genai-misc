Attendee Experience & Onsite Services

Document Owner: Attendee Experience Lead  
Version: 1.0  
Last Updated: 2025-08-23

## Overview
This protocol outlines how to plan and execute hospitality, concierge, and VIP services for conferences or events. It covers VIP welcome journeys, green room standards, escort procedures, gifting programs, and handling special requests. The document includes functional run sheets so a new team member can step in and deliver services consistently.

Scope:
- Applies to in-person, multi-day events (100–5,000 attendees).
- Includes VIPs (speakers, C-suite, government officials), sponsors, and special guests.
- Interfaces with Registration, Transportation, Security, F&B, Production/Stage Management, Venue Ops, Legal/Compliance, and IT/AV.

Key Definitions:
- VIP Tiers:
  - Tier 1 (T1): Headliners (keynote speakers), C-level executives, government officials, celebrity talent.
  - Tier 2 (T2): Sponsor executives, featured speakers, board members, press with special access.
  - Tier 3 (T3): Influencers, partners, prospects with elevated access.
- Movement: Any planned or ad hoc escort of a VIP from point A to B.
- Green Room: A controlled-access lounge/backstage area for VIPs and speakers.

Guiding Principles:
- Privacy first: minimize exposure, protect PII, strict access control.
- Time is the asset: reduce friction, buffer schedules, pre-brief staff.
- Safety and dignity: accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and consent always.
- Consistency: standardize amenities and process; personalize within guardrails.

Example Event Context (for illustrations):
- Venue: Moscone Center, San Francisco
- Dates: May 6–8
- Attendance: 2,500
- VIPs: 40 (T1: 8, T2: 12, T3: 20)
- Speakers: 24
- Concierge Desk: South Lobby, 07:00–19:00 daily
