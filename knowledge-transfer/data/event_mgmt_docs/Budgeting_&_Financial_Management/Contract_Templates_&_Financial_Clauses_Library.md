- Guidance notes and options for different risk and budget scenarios

Legal note: These templates are for operational use and do not constitute legal advice. Always route exceptions and non-standard terms to Legal.

6) Delivery and Change Control

Event: [Event Name], [Venue], [City, State/Country], on [Dates]

1. Scope of Services
Vendor shall provide the services and deliverables described in the Statement of Work (SOW) attached as Exhibit A, including all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete the services safely and on time.
Guidance: Keep pricing and deliverables in SOW to control scope creep.

2. Term; Schedule
The term begins on Effective Date and ends upon final acceptance of services or [Date], whichever is later. Key dates: load-in [Date/Time], rehearsal [Date/Time], live days [Dates], strike [Date/Time].

3. Compensation and Payment
Option A (Milestones): Total NTE price: [Currency][Amount]. Payments: 30% deposit within 10 days of execution; 40% upon delivery of equipment on-site; 30% net-30 after event and acceptance.
Option B (Time & Materials capped): Rates per Exhibit B; monthly invoicing; aggregate cap of [Currency][Amount]; pre-approval required for overtime and rentals.
Invoices must reference PO [Number] and be sent to [AP Email]. Payment terms: net-30 from receipt of a valid invoice. Late fees: lesser of 1.0% per month or maximum lawful rate.
Guidance: Use milestones for budget certainty; cap T&M. Set deposit % based on vendor cash needs and market leverage.

4. Taxes; Withholding
Prices exclude sales/VAT unless stated. Vendor is responsible for its taxes, excluding Client income-based taxes. If withholding applies, Client will withhold and provide certificate; gross-up only if mandated in Exhibit C.
Guidance: Obtain W-9/W-8 and confirm tax profile before execution.

5. Changes
No changes to scope, deliverables, or price without a signed Change Order.

6. Acceptance
Client will inspect deliverables on-site and notify Vendor of nonconformity within 5 business days; Vendor shall promptly cure. Final acceptance upon cure or expiration of cure period without notice.

7. Cancellation and Termination
For Convenience by Client:
- If notice > 90 days before first on-site date: pay documented non-recoverable costs (with receipts), not to exceed 10% of NTE.
- 61–90 days: 25% of NTE or documented non-recoverable costs, whichever is less.
- 31–60 days: 50% of NTE or documented non-recoverable costs, whichever is less.
- 0–30 days: 100% of labor scheduled and custom or non-returnable materials plus 25% of remaining NTE.
For Cause by Client: Client may terminate for material breach after 10 days’ written notice and failure to cure; pay only for conforming work delivered to date.
For Convenience by Vendor: not permitted without Client’s written consent.
Guidance: Use a schedule that reflects actual build/customization timelines; ensure “non-recoverable costs” require documentation.

8. Force Majeure
Neither party is liable for failure or delay due to events beyond reasonable control, including acts of God, epidemics, public health emergencies, government orders, labor strikes (excluding the affected party’s workforce-only strikes), war, terrorism, utility outages, or venue closure, provided:
- The affected party gives notice within 5 days of awareness, with details and mitigation steps.
- Obligations are suspended only as necessary and resume promptly.
Rescheduling: If a force majeure prevents the Event on the scheduled dates, the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to reschedule within 12 months. Prepayments shall be applied to the rescheduled date; if no reschedule occurs, Vendor refunds all prepaid amounts for undelivered services within 30 days, less documented non-recoverable costs approved by Client in advance.
Economic hardship or price changes alone do not constitute force majeure.
Guidance: Add a reschedule window to protect prepaid spend.

9. Service Levels and Penalties
- AV Uptime: 99.5% uptime per show day; failure results in service credits equal to 5% of daily fee per 0.5% shortfall, capped at 20% of daily fee.
- Staffing Fill Rate: 100% of confirmed shifts; each missed shift credit equals 150% of hourly rate.
- Late Load-in: For each hour past agreed load-in causing rehearsal delay, credit 2% of NTE per hour, cap 10%.
Credits are applied against next invoice or refunded within 30 days if no balance remains.
Guidance: Tie credits to measurable outcomes; avoid unenforceable penalties—use “service credits” or “liquidated damages” based on reasonable pre-estimate of loss.
