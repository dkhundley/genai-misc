# Stakeholder Map & RACI Matrix
Event Strategy & Stakeholder Alignment

Document type: Guidance + Templates  
Audience: Event leads, project managers, and cross-functional partners  
Applies to: Any medium–large event (300+ attendees) with multiple internal and external stakeholders

---

## Overview
This document shows you how to:
- Identify and map internal and external stakeholders by influence and interest.
- Define decision rights and clarify who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI).
- Use a practical, example-based Stakeholder Map and RACI Matrix to accelerate approvals, reduce rework, and keep delivery on schedule.

What you get:
- A ready-to-use stakeholder mapping method and visualization.
- A complete example RACI grid for a 600-person B2B Customer Summit.
- Step-by-step instructions, governance checkpoints, and templates.

Expected outcomes:
- Clear ownership of decisions and tasks.
- Fewer conflicts and faster approvals at key milestones.
- Consistent communications by stakeholder group.

---

## Example Event Context (for illustration)
- Event: Annual Customer Summit
- Attendance: ~600 (customers, partners, prospects, press)
- Location: In-person, major city hotel + adjacent conference center
- Timeline: 24 weeks from kickoff to event date (E-24 to E-0)
- Budget: $1.2M target; sponsorship target $400K
- Success metrics: 90% capacity filled, NPS ≥ 60, 25 opportunities ≥ $50K influenced, press coverage in 5 industry outlets

---

## Definitions and Decision Rights
- Responsible (R): Does the work. There can be multiple Rs.
- Accountable (A): Owns the outcome and final decision. Exactly one A per task.
- Consulted (C): Provides input before a decision/action; two-way communication.
- Informed (I): Kept aware of progress/outcomes; one-way communication.

Complementary governance terms:
- Decision owner: The person in the A role for a decision.
- Decision gate: A formal checkpoint that requires certain As to sign off (e.g., Budget Lock, Venue Contract, Marketing Launch).
- Change control: When scope/date/budget changes, re-approval by relevant A roles is required.

---

## Quick-Start: How to Use This Document
1. Copy the stakeholder register and RACI templates (at the end).
2. Tailor the stakeholder list to your org and event.
3. Place each stakeholder on the Influence–Interest Map.
4. Confirm decision gates and who is Accountable at each.
5. Complete the RACI grid for your event’s tasks. One A per row.
6. Share the map and RACI during kickoff; collect feedback once.
7. Publish and baseline. Store in your project hub. Version-control changes.
8. Review at each decision gate; update if stakeholders or scope change.

- Preferred comms channel and cadence
- Risks/concerns
- Backup/Delegate

---

## Stakeholder Map Visualization (Influence vs Interest)
Plot stakeholders on a 2x2 to inform your engagement plan.

- High Influence / High Interest: manage closely (weekly check-ins, steering).
- High Influence / Low Interest: keep satisfied (executive summaries, gate approvals).
- Low Influence / High Interest: keep informed and engaged (regular updates, Q&A).
- Low Influence / Low Interest: monitor with minimal effort.

Example map (for the Customer Summit):

```
Influence →           Low                          High
Interest ↓
High         - Design/Creative (internal)      - Executive Sponsor (internal)
             - Exhibitors/Partners (external)  - Event Lead (internal)
             - Speakers (external)             - PR/Comms Lead (internal)
             - Sales Lead (internal)           - Legal Counsel (internal)
                                               - Venue/Operations (internal)
                                               - AV/Production Vendor (external)

Low          - HR/People Ops (internal)        - Finance Lead (internal)
             - Photographer (external)         - Data Privacy Officer (internal)
                                               - Procurement (internal)
```

Engagement guidance by quadrant:
- High/High: Steering committee; weekly decisions and risk reviews.
- High/Low: Monthly executive memo; involve only at decision gates.
- Low/High: Biweekly updates; use FAQs and office hours for input.
- Low/Low: Digest updates pre–major milestones.

To build this: assign numeric scores (1–5) for Influence and Interest per stakeholder; plot scores or generate a bubble chart (bubble size = impact on timeline).

---

## Decision Gates and Governance
- Gate 1: Strategy & Budget Target (E-22 to E-20) — Approvers: Executive Sponsor (A), Event Lead (R/C), Finance (C)
- Gate 2: Venue Selection & Contract (E-18 to E-16) — Approvers: Event Lead (A), Legal (C), Finance (C), Procurement (C)
- Gate 3: Marketing Launch (E-14 to E-12) — Approvers: Event Lead (A), Marketing (R/C), PR (C), IT/Reg (C)
- Gate 4: Program Announce/Keynotes (E-10 to E-8) — Approvers: Event Lead (A), Content Lead (R/C), PR (C)
- Gate 5: Production Lock (E-4) — Approvers: Event Lead (A), AV/Production (R/C), Venue/Ops (C), H&S (C)
- Gate 6: Go/No-Go (E-2) — Approvers: Executive Sponsor (A), Event Lead (R/C), H&S (C), Finance (C)
- Gate 7: Post-Event ROI Report (E+3 weeks) — Approvers: Executive Sponsor (A), Finance (R/C), Event Lead (C)

Change control: Any variance >10% budget, date changes, or major scope shifts require re-approval from the Gate’s Accountable and Consulted roles.

- ES = Executive Sponsor
- EL = Event Lead
- PM = Project Manager (PMO)
- FIN = Finance
- LEG = Legal
- MKT = Marketing Lead
- SAL = Sales Lead
- CON = Content Lead
- ITR = IT/Registration Platform
- OPS = Venue/Operations
- AVP = AV/Production Vendor
- SPO = Sponsorship Manager

RACI quality checks:
- Exactly one A per row.
- At least one R per row.
- Avoid over-consulting: >4 Cs on a task can slow decisions.
- ES should be A only for budget cap and Go/No-Go (keeps exec escalations clean).

---

## Responsibilities (Role Summaries)
- Executive Sponsor: Sets strategy guardrails; approves budget cap; final Go/No-Go; removes escalated blockers.
- Event Lead: Overall accountability for event outcomes; owns decisions at gates 2–5; drives cross-functional alignment.
- Project Manager (PMO): Builds/maintains plan, risks, RAID logs; tracks RACI adherence; runs governance cadence; maintains documentation.
- Finance: Budget modeling, tracking, reconciliation, ROI analysis; advises on trade-offs.
- Legal/Procurement: Contract review; terms negotiation; compliance with policy; advises on insurance and indemnification.
- Marketing: Campaign plan, brand/creative, website, email, paid media; coordinate with PR.
- Sales: Field enablement; invite lists; customer commitments; onsite meetings; lead capture plan.
- Content Lead: Agenda architecture; speaker sourcing; abstracts; session briefs; rehearsals.
- IT/Registration: Registration flow, data integrations, website forms; SLA for uptime; badging solutions.
- Venue/Operations: Room blocks; floor plans; F&B; load-in/out; service orders; onsite staffing.
- AV/Production Vendor: Stage design, lighting, audio, video, show calling; technical rehearsals; run-of-show execution.
- Sponsorship Manager: Prospectus, pricing, contracts; exhibitor ops; sponsor deliverables and SLAs.
- Data Privacy Officer: DPIA, consent language, cookie and email compliance; data retention.
- Health & Safety/Security: Emergency plan, permits, crowd management, incident response.

---

## Dependencies and Risk Flags
Critical dependencies:
- Venue contract signed before marketing launch (avoid date/location changes mid-campaign).
- Legal sign-off before any external commitment (speakers, sponsors, vendors).
- DPIA and consent language finalized before registration opens.
- Production design freezes before print deadlines and equipment orders (E-4).
- Catering and room blocks guarantee require updated forecast from Sales and Registration.

Common risks and mitigations:
- Late approvals at gates → Define SLAs and escalation path to ES; pre-brief decision makers with a one-pager.
- Overlapping Accountabilities → One A per decision; document in decision log.
- Sponsor underperformance → Stage gates: E-14 target 50% of goal; E-8 80%; introduce contingency packages.
- Speaker cancellations → Maintain alternates; rehearse backups; flexible run-of-show.
- Data breaches → Limit PII in spreadsheets; use SSO; DPO sign-off; run a privacy tabletop.

---

## Operating Norms and Tools
- Single source of truth: Project hub (e.g., Confluence/Notion) with versioned Stakeholder Map, RACI, and Decision Log.
- Tracking: Gantt or Kanban (e.g., Smartsheet, Asana, Jira) linked to RACI owners.
- Diagramming: Stakeholder map in Miro/Lucidchart; export as PNG for docs.
- Change control: Use a simple form capturing what changed, why, impact, and required approvals.

- High/Low: Gate memos, 1-page decision briefs, variance summaries.
- Low/High: Biweekly update email, FAQs, training links, office hours.
- Low/Low: Milestone digest; action-only if they have tasks.

5) Influence–Interest Scoring Guide
- Influence: ability to approve/block spend, legal, brand, or schedule (1 low – 5 high).
- Interest: degree of ongoing involvement and impact on their objectives (1 low – 5 high).

---

## Operating Tips
- Anchor the RACI to real decisions, not org charts; people with the budget or legal signature often need A.
- Limit A to one per row; if you must have co-approvers, document one A and one required C with veto rights.
- Publish a Decision Log; reference it in meeting notes.
- Schedule pre-reads 24 hours before gates; enforce SLAs.
- Revisit the map after major changes (budget shifts, new executives, venue change).

---

## Success Metrics for Alignment
- Gate approval lead time ≤ 3 business days.
- < 10% tasks missing RACI roles after kickoff.
- Zero critical decisions without a logged owner (A).
- ≤ 1 unplanned scope change after production lock.
- Post-event debrief completed ≤ 3 weeks after E-0.

---

Questions or requests for customization can be directed to the Event Lead and PMO. This document should be baselined at kickoff and versioned after each decision gate.
