# Permits, Licenses & Regulatory Compliance Checklist
Risk, Safety, Legal & Sustainability

Document Title: Permits, Licenses & Regulatory Compliance Checklist  
Document Description: Lists permits (fire, special events, pyrotechnics, liquor), authorities, lead times, and submission artifacts. Format: checklist with jurisdiction contacts and due dates.

---

## Overview
This checklist ensures your event obtains all required permits, licenses, and approvals; meets risk, safety, legal, and sustainability standards; and passes inspections. It is written for U.S.-based events but adaptable elsewhere. Always verify requirements with your local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), as rules and lead times vary by city/county/state.

Scope: Festivals, conferences, trade shows, concerts, outdoor/indoor pop-ups, street fairs, and corporate events, including those with tents, stages, food vendors, alcohol, pyrotechnics, generators, drones, or street closures.

Outcomes:
- Identify authorities, required permits, lead times, fees, and submission artifacts.
- Assign responsibility and due dates.
- Pass plan checks and inspections with zero-day-of denials.
- Integrate sustainability and accessibility compliance.

---

## Quick Timeline (Working Back from Event Day, “T0”)
- T-120 to T-90: Engage venue; define event footprint, dates, attendance; open permitting tracker; pre-apply meeting with AHJs.
- T-90 to T-60: Submit Special Event Permit and Street Closure (if applicable). Start insurance COIs. Begin ABC (alcohol) and Fire/Life Safety planning.
- T-60 to T-45: Submit Tent/Canopy; Building/Temporary Structure; Electrical; Noise Variance; Health Department (food); FAA UAS/Drone (if applicable).
- T-45 to T-30: Submit Pyrotechnics/SFX; finalize Security and Medical Plans; confirm traffic control plan.
- T-21 to T-10: Neighbor notification (if required); finalize insurance endorsements; vendor list locked.
- T-10 to T-3: Fire/life safety inspection scheduling; pre-construction walkthrough; confirm staffing and barricades.
- T0: Event operations; daily safety briefings; maintain compliance logs.
- T+1 to T+30: Tear-down inspections; waste diversion reporting; closeout payments; incident log/archive.

Note: These are typical; use the longest lead time required by your jurisdiction.

## How to Use This Checklist
- Create a shared “Permit Tracker” that lists each permit, owner, status, due date, fees, and links to artifacts.
- Book a Pre-Application Meeting with your city’s Special Events Office and Fire Marshal. Bring a draft site plan.
- Lock dependencies early: venue agreement, site plan, estimated attendance, hours, alcohol intent, power plan, and vendor list.

## Practical Tips to Prevent Denials/Delays
- Book a joint pre-application meeting with Fire, Police, DOT, and Health to resolve conflicts early.
- Use scaled plans with readable legends; include dimensions and clearance distances.
- Lock generator and tent placements early; maintain 20 ft fire lanes and proper separations.
- Submit neighbor notifications with maps and a clear hotline at least T-14 (or per requirement).
- Order barricades and ADA ramps when you submit the TCP to avoid supply shortages.
- Pay fees promptly; some agencies won’t schedule inspections until payment is received.
- Schedule fire inspections during normal hours; after-hours adds standby costs and risk.
- Record every AHJ approval in writing; save emails and permit PDFs in a central folder.

---

## Sustainability and Accessibility Compliance Must-Haves
- Waste: Minimum three-stream (recycle/compost/landfill) with clear signage; station every 100–150 ft; weigh or estimate volumes; report diversion within T+14.
- Power: Right-size generators; use Stage V/Tier 4 where available; no-idling > 3 minutes (local rules vary).
- Water: Provide refill stations; eliminate single-use plastic bottles where feasible.
- Procurement: Require vendors to use compostable or recyclable serviceware; prohibit polystyrene foam.
- Accessibility: ADA routes (firm, stable, slip-resistant), 1:12 ramp slopes, companion seating, assistive listening or ASL upon request, accessible restrooms and counters.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
- Changing site plan after submission: triggers re-review. Freeze plan by T-30; document any changes with revision clouds and version numbers.
- Missing flame certificates for tents: obtain NFPA 701 certs from tent vendor before Fire submission.
- Underestimating police/traffic costs: confirm staffing estimates in writing; build 20–30% contingency.
- Inadequate ADA routes: plan from parking/drop-off to seating and restrooms; walk the route during load-in.
- Late COIs or missing endorsements: share COI requirements with all vendors at contract signing.
- No proof of neighbor notification: keep copies of mailers/door hangers and a distribution map.
