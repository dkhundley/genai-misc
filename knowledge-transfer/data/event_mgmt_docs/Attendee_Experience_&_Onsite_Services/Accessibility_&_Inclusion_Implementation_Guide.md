## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions, checklists, and templates to plan and deliver an accessible, inclusive event aligned with ADA Title III (U.S.), WCAG 2.1 AA for digital content, and industry best practices. It covers:

- Venue and ADA compliance
- Real-time captioning and media accessibility
- Sign language interpreting
- Dietary inclusion and allergen management
- Sensory accommodations (quiet spaces, lighting/sound, sensory kits)
- Service request intake, vendor engagement, run-of-show integration, and onsite quality assurance

Scope: Applies to all company-produced events (in-person, hybrid, and livestreams) with 50+ attendees. For events <50 attendees, scale requirements proportionally but maintain the same standards.

Objectives:
- Guarantee a baseline level of accessibility without requiring attendees to disclose.
- Provide a transparent process for requesting accommodations with timely confirmations.
- Reduce risk (legal, health/safety, reputational) through documented procedures.

Success measures:
- 100% of accessibility commitments delivered as scoped.
- 95% attendee satisfaction among those who request accommodations.
- Zero critical incidents (e.g., denied access, allergen exposure, interpreter no-show).
