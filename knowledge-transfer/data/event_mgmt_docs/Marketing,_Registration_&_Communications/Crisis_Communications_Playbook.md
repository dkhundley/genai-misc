# Crisis Communications Playbook
Marketing, Registration & Communications

## Overview
Purpose: Provide a clear, actionable framework to prepare for, respond to, and recover from incidents that impact attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, vendors, and the public during the lifecycle of our events (pre-event, on-site, and post-event). This playbook defines approval workflows, spokesperson roles, holding statements, and channel protocols.

Scope: Applies to any event produced or supported by the Marketing, Registration & Communications teams, including in-person, hybrid, and virtual conferences. Incidents include safety, security, weather, venue issues, data/privacy, technology outages, speaker/sponsor controversies, and transportation disruptions.

Principles:
- Safety first; never compromise attendee well-being.
- Speed with accuracy; inform quickly and update frequently.
- Empathy and clarity; write for a stressed reader.
- Single source of truth; link to a status page and keep it current.
- Legal and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA where applicable).
- Accessibility and inclusion; provide plain language, captions, alt text, and translations when possible.

Key outcomes:
- Time to first public update ≤ 15 minutes for critical incidents.
- Consistent, approved messaging across all channels.
- Traceable decisions, message iterations, and accountable owners.

---

## Incident Types and Severity Levels
Incident types (non-exhaustive):
- Medical emergency or fatality
- Security threat or criminal activity
- Severe weather or natural disaster
- Venue infrastructure failure (power, water, HVAC)
- Technology outage (registration, mobile app, livestream)
- Data/privacy incident or cyberattack
- Transportation disruption (strikes, closures)
- Speaker/sponsor controversy or protest
- Public health advisory (communicable disease)

Severity levels and SLAs:
- SEV-1 (Critical): Threat to life/safety, major security issue, fatality, mass outage affecting all attendees, confirmed data breach. First public update ≤ 15 min; updates at least every 30 min.
- SEV-2 (High): Significant disruption to event operations, partial outage, severe weather watch, unverified but credible threat. First update ≤ 30 min; updates at least every 60 min.
- SEV-3 (Moderate): Noticeable inconvenience (e.g., delayed registration lines, speaker cancellation), localized issue. First update ≤ 60 min; updates as status changes.
- SEV-4 (Low/Advisory): Minimal impact or potential issue requiring monitoring. First update as needed; at least daily notes on status page if ongoing.

---

## Activation and Governance
How incidents are reported:
- Any staff member or vendor can trigger an incident report via:
  - On-site: radio call “Code Comms” + brief description.
  - Hotline: +1-555-0100 (24/7 during event week).
  - Slack #incident-reports channel (include photo/video if safe).

Immediate triage:
1. On-duty Comms Lead acknowledges within 5 minutes.
2. Assigns provisional severity and creates Incident ID (e.g., 2025-ConfNYC-SEV1-003).
3. Opens Incident Log in shared drive (Incidents/2025/ID).

War room activation (virtual or on-site):
- For SEV-1/2: assemble Incident Team within 10 minutes via Zoom bridge or War Room A.
- For SEV-3/4: Comms Lead coordinates asynchronously.

Core roles:
- Incident Commander (IC): Head of Communications; accountable for message strategy and timing.
- Safety/Security Liaison: Coordinates with venue security, EMS, and law enforcement.
- Registration/Tech Liaison: Owns registration systems, app, web, livestream status.
- Legal Counsel: Reviews statements for liability/privacy risks.
- Public Information Officer (PIO)/Spokesperson: Delivers media and public statements.
- Social/Community Lead: Publishes updates and monitors sentiment.
- Stakeholder Liaison: Manages sponsors, speakers, and VIP communications.
- Note Taker: Maintains the Incident Log and change history.

Escalation:
- If IC is unavailable > 5 minutes, Deputy IC assumes command.
- IC may escalate to Executive Sponsor (CMO/COO) for SEV-1 or reputational crises.

---

## Approval Workflow (First 60 Minutes)
Timeboxes assume SEV-1/2. For SEV-3/4, extend timelines proportionally.

0–5 minutes:
- Acknowledge report; create Incident ID, set provisional severity.
- Notify core roles via SMS and Slack.
- IC appoints PIO and confirms legal counsel availability.

5–15 minutes:
- Gather facts using the 5 Ws (what, where, when, who, what’s next).
- Draft holding statement (Template A) + status page update.
- Legal review (max 5 min) for safety and liability; if unavailable, use pre-approved safety-focused holding statement.
- IC approves; Social/Community Lead publishes across defined channels based on severity matrix.
- Direct comms to on-site staff via Ops radio and SMS as needed.

15–30 minutes:
- Assess information gaps; request official inputs (security, venue, tech).
- Update status page; issue second update with specifics and next steps.
- Prepare stakeholder-specific notifications (attendees, speakers, sponsors, staff).
- PIO prepares media response; press line greeting updated.

30–60 minutes:
- Schedule rolling updates (every 30–60 minutes).
- Open Q&A doc; define three key messages and off-limits areas.
- If disruption persists, publish operational changes (delays, room moves, virtual access details).
- Document all decisions in the Incident Log.

RACI for critical messaging:
- Responsible: Comms Lead (draft), Social Lead (publish)
- Accountable: IC
- Consulted: Safety/Security, Legal, Registration/Tech
- Informed: Executive Sponsor, Ops Director, Customer Support

Fast-track rule:
- If life safety is impacted, publish immediately with minimal content (Template A) and update within 15 minutes after legal review.
