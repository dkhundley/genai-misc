- Budget overrun with low CPL improvement: Shift to search/retargeting; pause underperforming platforms; tighten geo/role filters
- Venue capacity constraints: Implement waitlist; price step-ups; cap group discounts
- Compliance breach: Pre-launch legal review; audit consent logs; documented DPA with vendors
