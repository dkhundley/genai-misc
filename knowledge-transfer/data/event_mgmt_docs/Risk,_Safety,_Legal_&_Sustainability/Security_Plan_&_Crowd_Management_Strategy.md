## Threat Assessment

- Method: Likelihood (Low/Med/High) × Impact (Low/Med/High) with mitigation measures. Risk ratings are dynamic and reviewed daily.
- Top risks and mitigations:
  - Weapon/prohibited item entry (Med/High): Layered screening (bag policy, magnetometers, visual checks), amnesty boxes, secondary screening area, surveillance.
  - Crowd density and surge at stage front (Med/High): Front-of-stage (FOS) crash barriers with pens, pit team, hydration, relief gates, live monitoring of density (<4 persons/m² target).
  - Unauthorized entry/perimeter breach (Med/Med): 8 ft anti-climb fencing, roving perimeter patrols, CCTV, intrusion alarms at weak points.
  - Alcohol-related disorder (High/Med): ID checks, cut-off protocol, ejection process, SOBER team patrols, additional welfare station.
  - Severe weather (Low/High): Weather monitoring; triggers for lightning, wind, heat; shelter/evacuation plan and show stop criteria.
  - Medical incidents (Med/Med): ALS/BLS on site, AED distribution, rapid extraction routes, medical liaison in TOC.
  - Vehicle ramming near gates (Low/High): Rated vehicle barriers at approaches, bollards, traffic control, secure load-in windows.
  - Bomb threat/suspicious package (Low/High): Search protocols, standoff distances, evacuation/shelter-in-place decision tree, liaison with police EOD.
  - Drone incursion (Low/Med): No-fly notifications, signage, pilot liaison with local FAA/CAA, reporting and incident containment.
  - Fire/hot works/vendor hazards (Low/Med): Fire watch, extinguisher deployment, LP gas checks, vendor inspection checklist.
- Daily pre-open risk review: 10-minute briefing at TOC with updates on weather, staffing gaps, intelligence, and changes to site plan.

## Screening Operations

- Goals: Maintain throughput without compromising detection; minimize false positives; ensure respectful, lawful searches.
- Screening lanes:
  - Gate A (Main): 8 magnetometer lanes (estimated 300 persons/hour/lane) + 8 bag tables.
  - Gate B (ADA/Family): 3 lanes with wider spacing; one stroller/family lane.
  - Gate C (VIP/Guest List): 2 lanes; credential scan at pre-check tent.
- Throughput calculation:
  - Target arrival surge: 6,000 over 2 hours pre-headliner.
  - Required capacity at peak: ~3,000/hour. With 13 lanes total at 300/hour = 3,900/hour (30% buffer).
- Screening steps:
  1. Queue splitter directs to next free lane; signage communicates rules.
  2. Bag policy check before magnetometer; amnesty bin visible before entry.
  3. Magnetometer pass; if alarm, wand and targeted pat-down (same gender staff available).
  4. Secondary screening room for unresolved alarms or prohibited items; document incidents.
  5. Ticket scan/credential validate after screening (separation of duties).
- Special populations:
  - ADA/medical needs: Priority lane; manual inspection procedures; allow medically necessary items after inspection and documentation.
  - Minors and families: Family lane; stroller check per policy.

## Queue Design

- Objectives: Safe, efficient ingress; maintain neighbor access; ensure accessibility; minimize wait times; reduce conflict.
- Layout (per CAD SEC_Gates_Queues):
  - Serpentine lane banks using steel barricades or weighted stanchions; 10-foot (3 m) ingress corridors; 4-foot (1.2 m) ADA priority lane along perimeter.
  - Shade canopies/misting fans for heat conditions; nighttime lighting.
  - Queue storage capacity: 1,800 persons at G-A; 600 at G-B; 400 at G-C (total 2,800).
- Signage:
  - Pre-queue: Bag policy, prohibited items, “Tickets Ready,” “Empty Pockets.”
  - Dynamic signs for “Wait Time” with flip boards or digital display.
- Staffing:
  - Queue Marshals at 1 per 2 lanes; 1 Supervisor per gate; “floater” to address issues.
- Flow targets:
  - Max 12 minutes average wait time at peak; threshold alert at 15 minutes triggers opening of contingency lanes or redeployment of staff.
- ADA considerations:
  - Firm, stable, slip-resistant surfaces; minimum 1:12 slope; rest seating every 100 feet for extended waits.

## Barricade & Crowd Density Plan

- Front-of-Stage (FOS) configuration:
  - Modular steel crash barrier rated min 5 kN/m horizontal load.
  - Penning system: Stage Left, Center, Stage Right pens with dedicated entry/relief gates (“turtle gates”) and water stations at each pen.
  - Pit staffing: 1 staff per 8 linear feet of barrier during headliner; rescue platform at center; extraction route to medical.
- Egress and emergency breaks:
  - Every 50–75 feet, install emergency break points with removable pins (BP markers on CAD).
  - Do not obstruct egress with cable ramps or equipment.
- Perimeter:
  - 8 ft anti-climb fence with top rails inward; overlap and clamp every 8 feet; privacy scrim only where sightlines are not safety-critical.
- Vehicle interdiction:
  - Temporary rated barriers (K4 or higher equivalent) at road approaches to G-A and G-B, with 15 ft emergency swing gates for EMS.
- Density monitoring:
  - Targets: General audience <3 persons/m²; FOS pens <4 persons/m².
  - Monitoring tools: Drone-free manual spot counts from platforms; CCTV analytics where permitted; pit chief authority to relieve pressure and request show pauses.
