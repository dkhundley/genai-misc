# Agenda Architecture & Track Map
Program Design, Speakers & Content

Document purpose: Define the plenary vs. breakout balance, track themes, standard session lengths, and room allocations. Includes a grid schedule, capacity map, and conflict matrix to guide scheduling and team execution.

---

## Overview

This document provides the end-to-end structure and working templates for designing and publishing a conference agenda. It covers:
- Plenary vs. breakout balance and flow
- Track themes and tagging
- Standard session lengths and formats
- Room inventory and capacity allocations
- A grid schedule with example data
- A conflict matrix to prevent collisions (speaker, audience, topic)

Audience: Program committee, track leads, speaker managers, operations/venue team, A/V, and communications.

Primary deliverables:
- Approved Track Map
- Standardized Session Catalog (metadata complete)
- Published Grid Schedule (internal and public variants)
- Capacity Map (room specs, setup, and A/V)
- Conflict Matrix Report
- Sign-off and change control log

Assumption example (adapt to your event):
- Event: 2-day, single-venue conference; ~600 attendees
- Dates: October 14–15
- Venue: Harbor Convention Center (Level 2 + 3)
- Rooms: 1 plenary, 6 breakouts
- Tracks: 6
- Target mix: 20% plenary time; 80% breakout time

---

## Key Principles

1. Plenary vs. Breakout Balance
- Objective: Shared vision in plenary; tailored depth in breakouts.
- Ratio guideline: 20–30% plenary (opening, daily keynote, closing), 70–80% breakouts.
- Avoid “plenary creep”: Keep plenaries to 1–2 per day; cap total plenary content to 3 hours/day.

2. Track Design and Tagging
- 5–7 tracks for cognitive manageability.
- Each session tagged with:
  - Track (primary), Secondary tags (optional)
  - Audience segment (Exec, Product, Dev, Ops, Sales/CS)
  - Skill level (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Format (Talk, Panel, Workshop, Case Study)
  - Recording: Yes/No; Live demo: Yes/No
  - Accessibility considerations (ASL, captions, quiet room needed)
  - Predicted demand score (1–5)

3. Session Length Standards
- Plenary keynote: 45 minutes
- Featured plenary: 30 minutes
- Standard breakout talk: 45 minutes
- Panel: 60 minutes
- Deep dive: 90 minutes
- Workshop: 120 minutes
- Turnover buffer: 15 minutes between all sessions
- Hard breaks: morning (30 minutes), lunch (60 minutes), afternoon (30 minutes)

4. Room Allocation Rules
- Assign high predicted demand (4–5) to top-capacity rooms.
- No room flips between theater and classroom within a day unless pre-approved and staffed; limit to 1 flip/day/room.
- Recording requires quiet rooms; avoid adjacency to F&B or demo floors.
- ADA: Ensure at least one high-demand session per slot is in ground-level or elevator-accessible room with reserved seats and ADA aisles.

5. Flow and Safety
- Stagger dismissals by 5 minutes across floors if hallways are narrow.
- Keep lunch and exhibits proximate to reduce congestion.
- Maintain clear evacuation routes and limit occupancy to 85% of capacity during peak sessions.

## Conflict Matrix

Purpose: Identify and resolve scheduling collisions that degrade attendee experience or operational feasibility.

Define the entities:
- Speakers: no speaker in two places at once; 60-minute minimum between sessions for the same speaker.
- Audiences: avoid stacking too many sessions for the same segment in a single slot.
- Topics: avoid close duplicates competing head-to-head.
- Resources: recording crews, interpreters, and specialized A/V cannot be double-booked.

Data inputs (for each session):
- Speaker IDs, Track, Audience, Topic tags, Skill level, Predicted demand (1–5), Recording Y/N, Interpreter Y/N

Matrix Types and Checks:

1) Speaker-Time Matrix
- Rows: Speakers; Columns: Timeslots; Cell: Assigned session ID
- Rule: Max 1 assignment per speaker per slot; if speaker has 2 sessions in a day, separate by at least one slot.

2) Audience Distribution Matrix (per timeslot)
- Rows: Audience segments; Columns: Timeslots; Cell: Count of sessions targeted
- Rule: For a 6-room slot, ensure at least 4 distinct audience segments represented; max 2 sessions for the same segment in a slot.

3) Topic Similarity Matrix
- Rows/Columns: Sessions in same slot; Cell: Similarity score (0–1) using tags and keywords
- Rule: No pair > 0.7 similarity in the same slot unless in different skill levels and clearly differentiated.

4) Resource Utilization Matrix
- Rows: Resources (Recording Crew A/B, ASL Team 1, Live Demo Kit); Columns: Timeslots; Cell: Assigned room/session
- Rule: Do not exceed resource quantity; buffer 15 minutes for moves.

Example (abbreviated):

- Speaker-Time:
  - 10:45 (D1-S1): S-102 in Cypress; S-233 in Redwood; no duplicates
  - 11:45 (D1-S2): S-102 free; S-233 in Redwood again → Flag; move S-233 to D1-S5

- Audience Distribution at D1-S1:
  - Exec: 1; Product: 1; Dev: 1; Ops: 1; Sales/CS: 1; Leadership: 1 → Balanced (OK)

- Resource Utilization at D1-S4:
  - Recording Crew A: Redwood; Crew B: Cypress; Crew C: Willow → Aspen non-recorded only

Resolution workflow:
- SC runs checks; flags auto-generated in sheet.
- TL proposes swaps keeping room capacity fit.
- PD approves changes; SC updates grid; CL notified if public agenda impacted.

## Operational Rules and Guardrails

- Buffers: 15 minutes minimum between sessions in the same room; 30 minutes before/after plenaries.
- No parallel “like-for-like” hot topics: If two sessions share >0.7 similarity and demand 4–5, place them in different slots or very different rooms/levels/skills.
- Room flips: None after T-35 unless executive approval; add labor time to grid if flipping.
- ADA seating: Reserve first two rows with side aisles; ensure ramp access to stage where applicable.
- Overflows: Identify two overflow rooms with live feed for top two hot sessions per day; publish overflow signage.
- Recording: Post “recording in progress” notice and avoid adjacent loud F&B.
- Safety: Maintain max 85% seating utilization on any single session for egress; door counts every slot.

---

## Data and Tools

- Master Grid: Google Sheets or Airtable; one tab per day; columns = timeslots, rows = rooms; session IDs link to Session Catalog.
- Session Catalog fields:
  - Session ID, Title, Track, Audience, Skill, Format, Length, Speaker(s), Predicted Demand (1–5), Recording Y/N, Interpreter Y/N, Room Preferences, A/V Needs, Abstract (120–200 words), Tags (3–5), Status (Draft/Confirmed/Frozen)
- Capacity Map tab: Room, Capacity (by setup), Setup, Floor, A/V, Recording, Accessibility notes.
- Conflict Matrix tab: Automated formulas and conditional formatting; see templates below.
- Live Ops: Door clickers or app-based headcount; feed back into Grid to trigger room swaps for next slots if needed.

---

## Quality Checks and KPIs

- Seat utilization: 70–85% for top 10 sessions; average breakout 60–75%
- Conflicts: 0 speaker double-books; ≤1 high-similarity overlap per day
- Audience coverage: Each slot spans ≥4 audience segments
- Accessibility: 100% of recorded sessions have captions post-event
- Timing adherence: ≥95% sessions start/end on time
- Satisfaction: Session CSAT ≥4.3/5 on average

---

## Example Room Assignment Rationale (Applying Demand)

- “Kubernetes Cost Controls” (Predicted demand 5/5; ENG audience) → Redwood (300) with overflow Willow live feed.
- “Org Design Clinic” (Workshop, 120 min, interactive) → Maple (classroom, cap 60) with pre-reg cap at 60.
- “API Gateways: Patterns That Scale” (4/5) scheduled against low-similarity topics to broaden choice; placed in Redwood or Cypress depending on door counts earlier in day.

---

## Risk Mitigation

- If keynote cancels: Promote Featured Talk to plenary; extend morning break by 15 minutes; notify via app.
- Overcapacity: Trigger overflow rooms; CL posts push notification; door staff redirect at 90% fill.
- A/V failure: AV shift to backup recorders; if recording lost, offer post-event virtual re-record.
- Weather/transport delay: Start-of-day slots labeled “flex”; can absorb up to 15 minutes without breaking lunch.

---

## Acceptance and Sign-off

- Grid v2, Capacity Map, and Conflict Matrix marked Green by T-30.
- PD signs off; CL schedules public release T-21.
- Any changes after T-21 require PD approval and change log entry.
