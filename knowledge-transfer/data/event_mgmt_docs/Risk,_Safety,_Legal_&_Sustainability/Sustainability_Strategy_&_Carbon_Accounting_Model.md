## Overview

Purpose
- Provide a clear sustainability roadmap and a standard carbon accounting model for all company events (conferences, meetings, activations).
- Set measurable targets for waste, energy, travel emissions, supplier standards, and reporting.
- Define roles, processes, and a calculator workbook structure so any team can collect data, calculate emissions, and report consistently.

Scope
- Applies to all company-managed events globally, including in-person, hybrid, and virtual components.
- Emissions boundary covers direct operational energy, purchased energy, and value chain impacts. Categorized as per the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol: Scopes 1, 2, and relevant Scope 3 categories.

Guiding principles
- Avoid > Reduce > Replace > Compensate.
- Do no harm: legal compliance, safety-first operations, truthful claims.
- Data-driven decisions: comparable intensity metrics and continuous improvement.

## Strategic Objectives and Targets (Portfolio-Level)

Timeframe and KPIs are portfolio-wide across all events in the calendar year.

1. Carbon and energy
- 2025 baseline established by Q2-2025 using this model.
- Reduce location-based Scope 1+2 emissions per event-day by 30% by end-2027 vs. 2025 baseline.
- 100% market-based renewable electricity (RECs/Guarantees of Origin) for venues and temporary power by 2028.
- Eliminate on-site diesel generators by 2027; interim: 50% switch to renewable diesel (HVO) by 2026.

2. Travel and accommodation
- Reduce air travel emissions per attendee by 20% by 2026 and 50% by 2030 (vs. 2025 baseline) via event design, mode shift, and virtual participation.
- 70% of contracted room-nights with eco-certified hotels (e.g., Green Key, LEED, ENERGY STAR) by 2026.

3. Waste and materials
- Achieve ≥90% waste diversion from landfill by 2027 (recycling + composting + reuse).
- 80% plant-forward catering (by meal count) by 2026; eliminate beef in standard menus unless culturally required (exceptions documented).
- 80% of event materials by weight are reusable, rented, or verified recycled content by 2027; phase out PVC banners by 2026.

4. Supplier standards
- 100% of Tier-1 event suppliers sign Supplier Code of Conduct by contract signature date.
- By 2027, 70% of event spend with suppliers that publicly report emissions and have a near-term target (e.g., SBTi, equivalent).

5. Reporting and assurance
- Event-level carbon reports within 30 days post-event; portfolio annual report by March each year.
- Partial external assurance (limited) on annual GHG statement by 2027.

Event operations manager (per event)
- Gathers activity data (energy, waste, materials), ensures on-site compliance.

Travel manager / Registration lead
- Collects attendee origin/mode data; coordinates travel agency reporting.

Procurement
- Enforces supplier standards in RFPs and contracts; tracks certifications.

Venue/supplier focal points
- Provide metered data, manifests, certificates, and waste logs per template.

Legal/compliance
- Reviews green claims, supplier clauses, data privacy, and permits/licences.

Health & Safety
- Ensures safe handling of fuels, batteries, waste streams, and food safety.

IT/Data security
- Safeguards attendee data; manages survey and data collection tools.

Finance/Internal audit
- Reviews controls; supports assurance and budgeting for abatement measures.

---

## Legal, Safety, and Risk Controls

Legal/regulatory (jurisdiction-dependent; verify locally)
- Environmental: waste handling permits, hazardous waste, e-waste (WEEE), refrigerants, fuel storage (spill prevention), air quality rules.
- Energy/claims: renewable energy claims substantiation (RECs/GoOs, REGOs), marketing claims (FTC Green Guides, UK CMA Green Claims Code, EU Green Claims Directive in development).
- Privacy: attendee origin and travel data under GDPR/CCPA or local equivalents; collect minimum necessary, anonymize when possible.
- Labor/human rights: modern slavery/forced labor clauses, supplier due diligence (e.g., UK Modern Slavery Act, EU CS3D when applicable).
- Accessibility and inclusion: ensure venue and supplier standards meet ADA/equivalent.

Safety (examples)
- Generators, fuels: compliant storage, spill kits, trained operators; switch to grid or battery systems when feasible.
- Battery energy storage: fire safety plans, ventilation, manufacturer guidelines, fire service coordination.
- Waste sorting stations: ergonomic placement, sharps/contaminants controls, PPE for staff.
- Food: HACCP-compliant caterers, allergen labeling, safe food donations in line with local “Good Samaritan” laws.

Greenwashing risk mitigation
- Claims review by Legal before publication.
- Substantiate all metrics; retain data and calculation evidence for 7 years.
- Avoid “carbon neutral” claims unless emissions are fully accounted and high-integrity credits are retired; prefer “we measure, reduce, and fund climate solutions.”

## Carbon Accounting Methodology

Standards
- GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
- GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (location- and market-based).
- GHG Protocol Technical Guidance for Scope 3.
- ISO 14064-1 and ISO 20121 for event sustainability management (reference).

Organizational and operational boundary
- Event-level project boundary includes:
  - Scope 1: On-site fuels (e.g., diesel for generators, propane for heaters).
  - Scope 2: Purchased electricity (venue meters, temporary power). Location- and market-based are both reported.
  - Relevant Scope 3 (Category 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 as applicable): attendee and staff travel; hotel nights; catering; materials and freight; waste; supplier energy where data is available.

Base year
- 2025 is the base year for targets. Recalculate baseline if structural changes exceed 5% impact (e.g., major expansion, methodology change).

Materiality threshold
- Include categories expected to exceed 1% of event total CO2e or are strategically important (e.g., air travel). De minimis items <1% may be grouped but must be disclosed.

Calculation approach
- Emissions = Activity data × Emission factor ± allocation and adjustment (e.g., radiative forcing for air travel, well-to-tank if included).
- Prefer primary data (metered kWh, liters, manifests). If unavailable, use secondary data and documented assumptions (e.g., distance-based, spend-based as last resort).

Electricity accounting
- Report both location-based (grid average factor) and market-based (contractual instruments like RECs, PPAs; apply quality criteria).
- Residual mix where available; otherwise, location-based as proxy with clear disclosure.

Air travel radiative forcing (RF)
- Apply RF uplift (1.7–2.0) when policy requires a climate impact view beyond CO2. Default portfolio reporting uses DEFRA/BEIS well-to-wake factors where available to avoid double counting.

Offsets/credits policy
- Credits are a last resort for residual emissions. If used, meet ICROA-aligned criteria (additionality, permanence, leakage, verification) and disclose volume and vintage separately from gross emissions.

## Worked Example: 1,000-Person, 3-Day Conference (Illustrative Only)

Event parameters
- 1,000 attendees; 3 days; 3,000 attendee-days.

Travel (assumed mode and distance mix)
- 40% short-haul flights, 2,000 km return each: 400 × 2,000 × 0.20 kg = 160,000 kg
- 20% long-haul flights, 12,000 km return each: 200 × 12,000 × 0.15 kg = 360,000 kg
- 30% rail, 200 km return each: 300 × 200 × 0.035 kg = 2,100 kg
- 10% car, 100 km return each, 0.12 kg/pkm: 100 × 100 × 0.12 kg = 1,200 kg
- Travel subtotal: 523,300 kg CO2e (523.3 t)

Accommodation
- 3,000 room-nights × 15 kg = 45,000 kg (45.0 t)

Energy
- Venue electricity: 50,000 kWh × 0.35 kg = 17,500 kg (17.5 t)
- Diesel generator: 2,000 liters × 2.68 kg = 5,360 kg (5.4 t)
- Energy subtotal: 22,860 kg (22.9 t)

Catering
- 6,000 meals: 70% veg ×1.0 kg + 25% poultry ×2.0 kg + 5% beef ×7.0 kg
- 4,200 + 3,000 + 2,100 = 9,300 kg (9.3 t)

Materials
- Paper 500 kg × 1.3 = 650 kg
- Vinyl banners 200 kg × 6.0 = 1,200 kg
- Swag 300 kg × 5.0 = 1,500 kg
- Materials subtotal: 3,350 kg (3.35 t)

Waste
- 5,000 kg total; 40% landfill × 0.45 = 900 kg; 30% recycle × 0.10 = 150 kg; 30% compost × 0.20 = 300 kg
- Waste subtotal: 1,350 kg (1.35 t)

Total gross emissions (illustrative): ~605,160 kg CO2e (605.2 t)
- Intensity: 605,160 kg / 3,000 attendee-days = 201.7 kg CO2e per attendee-day
- Key insight: Air travel dominates (>85%), guiding priority actions (venue selection, mode shift, virtual options).

## Notes on Claims and Communications

- Always state whether emissions are location- or market-based for electricity.
- Disclose boundaries and material exclusions (>1% threshold only with justification).
- If credits are used, report gross emissions, reductions achieved, and credits retired separately. Avoid implying “zero emissions” from reductions alone.
- Retain calculations, factors, and evidence for audit and public inquiries.
