## Overview

Purpose  
Design and execute onsite activations that foster meaningful attendee connections through matchmaking, lounges, hosted meetups, and structured icebreakers. This plan is turnkey—teams can deploy with minimal additional context.

Scope  
- Event profile (example): 1,500 attendees, 2.5 days, indoor venue, expo + sessions, mobile event app.  
- Activations included:  
  - Smart Matchmaking (pre-scheduled 1:1s + concierged intros)  
  - Networking Lounges (social, quiet, career, wellness)  
  - Hosted Meetups (topic-based, role-based, sponsor-led)  
  - Icebreakers (drop-in and scheduled)

Objectives  
- Increase relevant connections and community belonging.  
- Reduce friction and social anxiety for first-time attendees.  
- Provide measurable sponsor value (if applicable).

Key Success Metrics (KPIs)  
- Adoption: 65%+ of attendees opt-in to matchmaking; 40%+ use lounges.  
- Output: 1,800+ 1:1 meeting requests; 1,000+ confirmed meetings.  
- Engagement: Average lounge dwell time ≥ 12 minutes; 80%+ seat fill at meetups.  
- Satisfaction: Networking NPS ≥ +45; “Made valuable connections” ≥ 85% agree.  
- Sponsor ROI (if sponsor present): 100+ qualified engagements in sponsored zones.
