## Key Steps (How-To)

### Create a New Social Post Graphic
1) Open Figma > Nexus 2025 > Templates > Social.  
2) Duplicate the correct size frame (e.g., LinkedIn 1200x1350).  
3) Insert messaging following tone rules; use Inter for headlines.  
4) Place approved photo or illustration; apply 15% gradient overlay if needed.  
5) Add logo in a corner with 24 px padding; ensure 4.5:1 contrast.  
6) Export as JPG (80% quality, sRGB); name using convention.  
7) Upload to DAM and attach copy, alt text, and scheduled date.

### Implement Registration Theme
1) Upload SVG logo and favicon; set primary/secondary colors per palette.  
2) Set typography to Inter or platform equivalent; adjust button styles.  
3) Upload hero (1600x600) and OG (1200x630) images.  
4) Configure email templates: header 600x200, button color, alt text.  
5) Test for mobile responsiveness, dark mode, and contrast.  
6) QA checklist: Link tracking, preheader length, logo contrast, footer legal.  
7) Publish to staging; secure Brand Manager approval before production.

### Prepare Print-Ready Banner
1) Use the 33"x80" banner template (CMYK, 150 dpi).  
2) Keep critical content within 1" safety; avoid small type (<18 pt).  
3) Place 1-color white logo on Nexus Blue or Dark background for maximum contrast.  
4) Export PDF/X-1a with embedded fonts and 0.125" bleed.  
5) Send to vendor with color references (Pantone) and delivery deadline.
