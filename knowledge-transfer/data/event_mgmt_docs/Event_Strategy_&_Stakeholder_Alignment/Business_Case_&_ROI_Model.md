## Model Architecture (Spreadsheet Structure)

Create a single workbook with the following tabs. Lock formulas and color-code cells (blue = inputs, black = formulas, grey = headers).

1) Cover & Read Me  
- Purpose, version control, owner, last updated, change log.  
- Link to documentation and data sources.

2) Inputs & Assumptions  
- Event profile (type, dates, city, audience).  
- Financial parameters (discount rate, gross margin, currency, FX).  
- Funnel rates, ASP, ticket/sponsor pricing, attendance assumptions.  
- Retention/expansion and brand lift assumptions.  
- Scenario controls (switch for Conservative/Base/Aggressive).

3) Event Plan & Costs (Bottom-up)  
- Venue, F&B, A/V & staging, production, décor, staffing, travel, marketing, tech, swag, insurance, contingency.  
- Quantity x unit cost = line item totals; timing by month (for cash flow).

4) Demand & Registration  
- Top-of-funnel (impressions → clicks → registrations → shows).  
- Paid/organic split; conversion rates by channel; no-show rate; VIP comps.

5) Sponsorship & Ticketing  
- Pricing tiers, inventory, sold-through, discounts, payment timing.  
- Ticket categories (early-bird, standard, on-site, comp), average realized price.

6) Funnel & Revenue Impact  
- Leads (net-new) and touches (influenced) mapped to MQL → SQL → Opp → Win.  
- ASP, win rate, sales cycle, in-period close % for revenue recognition.

7) Customer Impact (Retention & Expansion)  
- Attending customers: base ARR, churn reduction, expansion uplift, ramp.

8) Brand Lift & Media Value  
- PR coverage, SOV, organic traffic, search interest, social reach.  
- Monetization via paid media equivalency and/or incremental CPL.

9) Calculations & Cash Flow  
- Consolidate all benefits and costs by month; apply margins and discounting.  
- NPV, IRR (if multi-year), payback period, ROI.

10) Scenarios  
- Conservative/Base/Aggressive driver sets with switch-controlled outputs.

11) Sensitivity  
- One- and two-variable tables (e.g., attendance vs. win rate → ROI).  
- Tornado chart inputs (top 8 drivers of variance).

12) Outputs & Dashboard  
- Executive KPI view: total cost, cash revenue, pipeline, new ARR, retention/expansion ARR, brand value, ROI, NPV, payback, breakeven attendance.

13) Data Sources & Definitions  
- Source systems, query owners, refresh cadence, metric definitions, UTM schema, CRM campaign IDs.

## Key Details and Steps

Step 1: Define event objectives and scope  
- Objective hierarchy: 1) Net-new pipeline, 2) Accelerate pipeline/close, 3) Customer retention/expansion, 4) Brand lift, 5) Partner ecosystem.  
- Event archetype: own conference (monetizable), third-party expo, roadshow series.  
- Monetization model: sponsorship tiers, ticketing, partner revenue share.  
- Time horizon: model in-period impact (through fiscal year) and multi-year CLTV uplift where relevant.

Step 2: Collect baseline data (owners in parentheses)  
- Historical event performance (Marketing Ops): attendance, CPL, conversion rates.  
- CRM funnel baselines (Sales Ops): MQL→SQL, SQL→Opp, win rate, ASP, cycle length.  
- Finance metrics (Finance BP): gross margin, discount rate, overhead burden.  
- Customer metrics (CS Ops): churn, expansion, NRR by segment.  
- Brand baselines (Brand/Analytics): organic traffic, awareness, SOV.  
- Sponsorship history (Partner/Alliances): pricing, sell-through, payment terms.

Step 3: Build the cost model (bottom-up)  
- Estimate quantities before unit costs (e.g., attendee meals, session rooms).  
- Include procurement fees, taxes, service charges, tips, and buffer contingency (10–15%).  
- Time costs by month to drive cash flow.  
- Example cost lines (Base scenario):  
  - Venue rental: $180,000  
  - F&B: 700 pax × $280/day × 1.5 days = $294,000  
  - A/V & staging: $220,000  
  - Production & creative: $120,000  
  - Event staff & travel: $85,000  
  - Marketing & paid media: $110,000  
  - Tech stack (reg, app, lead capture): $25,000  
  - Swag & print: $35,000  
  - Insurance, permits, misc: $26,000  
  - Contingency (10% applicable lines): ~$106,000  
  - Total estimated cost: ~$1,201,000

Step 4: Forecast demand and attendance  
- Model by channel with explicit conversion rates:  
  - Impressions × CTR × LP CVR × Registration completion × Show rate.  
- Account for comps/VIPs separately (impact cost but not revenue).  
- Example (Base):  
  - Paid: 6M impressions × 0.35% CTR × 14% LP CVR × 92% completion = 2,702 registrations; 60% show = 1,621 shows  
  - Organic: 1.2M impressions × 0.65% CTR × 12% LP CVR × 90% completion = 842 registrations; 70% show = 589 shows  
  - Total shows = 2,210 (cap to venue if needed); assume cap of 700 for an intimate customer conference → allocate by priority.

Step 5: Sponsorship and ticket revenue  
- Sponsorship (Base):  
  - 3× Gold @ $85k = $255k; 5× Silver @ $35k = $175k; 6× Bronze @ $12k = $72k  
  - Early commit discount −$32k; net = $470k; 60% cash pre-event, 40% on delivery.  
- Ticketing (Base):  
  - 500 paid attendees; blended realized price $350; revenue = $175k; fees −$7k; net = $168k.  
- Total cash revenue (Base): ~$638k.

Step 6: Pipeline and new revenue impact  
- Net-new pipeline:  
  - Leads → MQL → SQL → Opp → Wins with ASP and win rate.  
  - Example (Base): 900 MQLs × 35% × 50% × 20% = 31 wins; ASP $60k ARR → New ARR closed in-year = 31 × $60k × 60% in-year close = $1.116M.  
- Influenced pipeline acceleration:  
  - 120 touched opps × $80k size × (p_after − p_before 0.38−0.35=0.03) → Incremental expected ARR = $288k (apply margin/discounting in Calc tab).

Step 7: Customer retention and expansion  
- Identify attending customers, base ARR, and apply uplifts only to exposed cohort.  
- Example (Base):  
  - 250 attending customer accounts; base ARR $12M.  
  - Churn reduction: 7.0% → 5.5% (improvement 1.5pp) → $180k ARR preserved in-year.  
  - Expansion uplift: +0.7% on $12M → $84k incremental ARR.  
  - Total retention/expansion benefit = $264k ARR.

Step 8: Brand lift monetization (use conservative methods)  
- Method A (Lead-value basis): incremental organic sessions × lead rate × CPL.  
  - Example: 40k incremental sessions, 1.2% lead rate, CPL $150 → $72k value.  
- Method B (Paid media equivalency): PR impressions × CPM benchmark × quality factor.  
  - Example: 18M earned impressions × $5 CPM × 0.8 quality = $72k (choose the lower of A/B for Base).

Step 9: Consolidate benefits, apply margin and discounting  
- Finance parameters (Base): gross margin 80%, discount rate 10% annual, analysis window = event month + 12 months.  
- Benefits (Base, approximate):  
  - Cash revenue: $638k  
  - New ARR in-year margin: $1.116M × 80% = $892.8k  
  - Influenced expected ARR (confidence 50%): $288k × 50% × 80% = $115.2k  
  - Retention/expansion ARR margin: $264k × 80% = $211.2k  
  - Brand value (treated as marketing value, not margin): $72k  
  - Total modeled benefit ≈ $1.929M  
- Costs: ~$1.201M  
- Net benefit ≈ $728k  
- ROI = Net benefit / Cost ≈ 61%  
- Payback (months) = months until cumulative benefits ≥ cumulative costs (show in Cash Flow tab).  
- NPV: discount monthly cash flows at 10% annual.

Step 10: Build scenarios and set go/no-go thresholds  
- Drivers: attendance, win rate, ASP, sponsorship sold, ticket price, cost variance, churn reduction, expansion uplift, brand lift.  
- Example scenarios:  
  - Conservative: −20% attendance; win rate 15%; ASP $50k; sponsorship −30%; costs +10%; churn reduction 0.5pp; brand value −50%.  
  - Base: as above.  
  - Aggressive: +25% attendance; win rate 25%; ASP $70k; sponsorship +25%; costs −5%; churn reduction 2.5pp; brand +50%.  
- Define stage gates (kill/scale decisions):  
  - T−12 weeks: ≥40% of sponsorship target contracted; ≥35% of registration target in.  
  - T−8 weeks: ≥60% of sponsorship; ≥60% of registrations; C-19 contingency plan locked.  
  - T−6 weeks: if below thresholds, present scale-down plan or cancel.

Step 11: Sensitivity analysis  
- One-variable tables: ROI vs win rate, ROI vs attendance, ROI vs ASP, ROI vs cost overrun.  
- Two-variable table: Attendance (x) vs Win rate (y) → ROI.  
- Tornado: show top impact drivers by delta from Base to ±10–20% changes.

Step 12: Output and communicate  
- Dashboard: show ROI, NPV, payback, breakeven attendance, sponsorship gap, ticket gap, and risk flags.  
- Executive summary slide: ask (budget), Base/Cons/Agg outcomes, key assumptions, gates.  
- Secure sign-offs from Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Exec Sponsor.

Step 13: Post-event actuals and learning  
- Replace forecasts with actuals (costs, attendance, sponsorship, tickets).  
- Update CRM outcomes at 30/60/90/180 days; refresh retention/expansion after 6–12 months.  
- Compare deltas from assumptions; record learnings into Inputs for next cycle.

## Core Formulas (use in Calculations tab)

- Paid registrations = Impressions × CTR × LP_CVR × Completion  
- Shows = Registrations × (1 − No-show rate)  
- Ticket revenue net = Paid attendees × ARP − Fees  
- Net-new wins = MQLs × MQL_to_SQL × SQL_to_Opp × Win_rate  
- New ARR in-year = Net-new wins × ASP × In_year_close%  
- Influenced incremental expected ARR = Σ[(p_after − p_before) × Deal_size]  
- Retention ARR preserved = Exposed_base_ARR × Churn_reduction_pp  
- Expansion ARR uplift = Exposed_base_ARR × Expansion_uplift%  
- Brand value (lead basis) = Incremental_sessions × Lead_rate × CPL  
- Margin-adjusted benefit = Benefit × Gross_margin (except brand equivalency if treated as non-margin)  
- ROI = (Total benefits − Total costs) / Total costs  
- Payback month = MIN month where cumulative benefits ≥ cumulative costs  
- NPV = Σ(Cash_flow_t / (1 + r)^(t/12))

Example Excel snippets  
- Net-new wins: =MQLs * MQL_to_SQL * SQL_to_Opp * WinRate  
- Two-variable sensitivity (Data Table): set ROI cell as the formula; rows = Attendance values; columns = WinRate values; Data → What-If → Data Table (Row input = WinRate cell; Column input = Attendance cell)
