# Timeline & Governance Cadence
Event Strategy & Stakeholder Alignment

Document purpose: Define milestones, stage gates, steering committee rhythm, and decision forums to keep an event program on track. This knowledge item is standalone and ready to adopt for any mid-to-large event. It includes a sample Gantt (with critical path) and a governance calendar with agendas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This document outlines:
- A phased timeline and stage gates with entry/exit criteria (what is due by when and who approves it).
- A Gantt-style schedule with critical path activities you must protect.
- Governance cadence: the rhythm of meetings, decision forums, and escalation paths.
- Responsibilities and dependencies across key workstreams.
- Templates to manage RAID (risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies), change control, decisions, and agendas.

Who should use this:
- Event lead/Project Manager, Workstream leads (Program, Marketing, Ops, Finance, Technology), Executive Sponsor, and Steering Committee members.

How to use this:
1) Set your Event Date (T0).
2) Map the relative timeline (T-24 weeks, T-12 weeks, etc.) to calendar dates.
3) Confirm roles and fill in names.
4) Adopt the governance cadence and templates.
5) Track milestones and keep the decision log current.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assumptions (Example Event)

- Event: Annual Customer Summit (in-person, 600 attendees, 1.5 days + expo)
- Event Date (T0): Thursday, May 14, 2026

- Budget: $1.2M USD with a 10% contingency
- Target registration live: T-16 weeks
- Keynote talent: 2 external paid speakers, 4 internal executives

Note: If your event date differs, use the relative T- weeks and convert to absolute dates. For example, T-24 weeks ≈ Nov 28, 2025 when T0 = May 14, 2026.

- Production SOW (Gate 3): R=Ops, A=SC, C=Finance/Legal/PM, I=All Leads
- Content lock (Gate 4): R=Program Lead, A=PM, C=Brand/Accessibility, I=SC
- Go/No-Go (Gate 5): R=PM, A=ES, C=SC/Security/Finance, I=All

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dependencies (Common Patterns)

- Venue contract (Gate 1) → Production design, floorplan, exhibitor kit.
- Budget baseline (Gate 1) → Vendor commitments, paid campaigns, speaker contracts.
- Program architecture (Gate 2) → Speaker sourcing, content development, marketing content.
- Registration platform live → Lead capture and campaign conversion.
- AV/production SOW (Gate 3) → Run-of-show, rehearsals, staging, print/signage measurements.
- Content lock (Gate 4) → Print/signage, teleprompter, translation/captioning, ROS freeze.
- Sponsor entitlements → Floorplan, signage inventory, session slots, registration types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Controls: Risks, Issues, and Change

Thresholds:
- Budget changes >$25k or >5% of baseline require SC approval.
- Timeline slippage on CP >3 business days requires immediate SC escalation.
- Scope adds that affect attendee experience or safety require SC approval.

Risk Management:
- Maintain a RAID log; review weekly in standup; red items escalated to SC.
- Define triggers and owners for contingency plans (e.g., keynote cancellation, shipment delays).

Change Control:
- Use the Change Request (CR) form; every CR includes impact analysis and recommendation.
- CCB reviews within 5 business days (or sooner inside T-4 weeks).
- Approved changes update baselined plan and are communicated to all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Two-Week Lookahead Rhythm (Example)

Every Friday, PM circulates:
- Updated Gantt with CP highlights and milestone forecast.
- KPI snapshot: registrations to goal, sponsor revenue, budget burn, critical risks.
- Decisions required next week with proposed options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start: First 72 Hours

1) Confirm T0 and convert all T- markers to dates.
2) Appoint ES, SC members, PM, and Workstream Leads; capture contact list.
3) Approve Gate 0: Charter, budget range, governance model.
4) Publish the governance calendar (recurring invites) and agendas.
5) Stand up artifacts: Gantt, RAID log, Decision log, Change log, Deliverable tracker.
6) Kick off venue sourcing and budget baseline work immediately (protect the CP).

## Notes on Tailoring

- Adjust thresholds (budget/time) to your organization’s risk tolerance.
- Add workstreams (e.g., Virtual Platform, Translation, Sustainability) as needed.
- Expand critical path if your event has construction, complex rigging, or international shipping.
- For multi-day, multi-track events, add a Content QA buffer (1–2 weeks) prior to Gate 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By adopting this timeline and governance cadence, your team will have clear milestones, decision rights, and rhythms to deliver a predictable, high-quality event.
