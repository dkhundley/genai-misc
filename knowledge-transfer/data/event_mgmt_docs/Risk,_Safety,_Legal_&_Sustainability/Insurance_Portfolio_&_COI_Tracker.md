# Insurance Portfolio & COI Tracker
Risk, Safety, Legal & Sustainability

Document Title: Insurance Portfolio & COI Tracker  
Document Description: Specifies required coverages (GL, auto, workers’ comp, event cancellation), limits, and certificate collection. Format: requirements checklist and COI tracking log.

## Overview
This document establishes the insurance requirements and certificate-of-insurance (COI) collection process for all events produced by our organization. It ensures risk is appropriately transferred to vendors, venues, and contractors; that we maintain compliant documentation; and that our own event insurance portfolio is adequate.

Scope:
- Applies to all live, hybrid, and virtual events with third-party vendors, venues, or exhibitors.
- Mandatory for events with any of the following: attendance >100, alcohol service, rigging or buildout, transportation, use of temporary staff, or international elements.

Definitions:
- COI (Certificate of Insurance): Evidence of insurance; it does not alter coverage. Endorsements are required to amend policy terms (e.g., Additional Insured).
- Additional Insured (AI): Our organization and specified entities are covered under the vendor’s policy for claims arising from the vendor’s work.
- Primary & Noncontributory: Vendor’s insurance responds first without seeking contribution from our policies.
- Waiver of Subrogation: Insurer waives the right to seek recovery from us.

## Insurance Requirements by Coverage
Minimums shown are standard. Risk Manager may increase limits for higher-risk activities or jurisdictions. All policies must be written by insurers rated at least A- VII by AM Best (or equivalent).

Mandatory for most vendors and venues:
- Commercial General Liability (CGL)
  - Limits: $1,000,000 per occurrence; $2,000,000 general aggregate; $2,000,000 products/completed ops aggregate; $1,000,000 personal & advertising injury.
