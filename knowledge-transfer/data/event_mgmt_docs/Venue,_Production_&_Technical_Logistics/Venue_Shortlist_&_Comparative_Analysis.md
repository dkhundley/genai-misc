# Venue Shortlist & Comparative Analysis
Document type: Venue, Production & Technical Logistics

## Overview
This document provides a structured, side-by-side evaluation of shortlisted venues for a 1,200-person product launch and conference in New York City during the week of March 24–26, 2026. It includes a comparison matrix, site visit notes, photo references, risks, restrictions, and a weighted scoring model to support a go/no-go decision and contract execution.

Event profile:
- Format: 2-day conference with keynote (Stage A), secondary stage (Stage B), 20-booth expo, networking lounges, and live broadcast.
- In-person attendance: 1,200 (seated keynote), 800 (Stage B theater), 20 exhibitors.
- Technical: 60 ft x 40 ft main stage; 1.9mm LED wall up to 80 ft x 20 ft; 4-camera broadcast; 400A 3-phase power minimum; 40–60 rigging points; venue blackout preferred; robust internet with 1–2 Gbps dedicated uplink.
- Logistics: 6–8 trucks across two load-in days; union jurisdictions anticipated; ADA compliance required; public transit proximity preferred.

Shortlist for analysis:
1) Pier 36 (Lower East Side)
2) The Glasshouse (West Side)
3) Metropolitan Pavilion (Chelsea)
4) Duggal Greenhouse (Brooklyn Navy Yard)

Top-line recommendation:
- Recommended primary: Pier 36 (best technical fit, flexible load-in, acceptable cost, clean availability).
- Recommended secondary/backup: The Glasshouse (excellent attendee experience; higher cost; tighter load-in).
- Do not recommend for primary without scope changes: Metropolitan Pavilion (capacity and rigging constraints) and Duggal Greenhouse (access/union cost impact and weather exposure on approaches).

Decision deadline to secure dates and rates: September 20, 2025.
