# Risk Appetite & Decision Escalation Framework
Event Strategy & Stakeholder Alignment

Version: 1.0  
Owner: Event Director (Policy & Risk)  
Effective Date: 2025-09-01  
Review Cadence: Quarterly or after any Level 3 incident

---

## Overview

Purpose  
- Establish clear risk appetite, thresholds, and decision rights to enable timely, aligned decisions during event planning and live operations.
- Define trigger conditions and escalation paths for safety, financial, operational, legal/compliance, reputation, and technology risks.
- Provide an escalation flow and contact tree to reduce ambiguity during time-sensitive situations.

Scope  
- Applies to all company-sponsored events (conferences, expos, festivals, VIP dinners, roadshows), from planning through post-event wrap.
- Covers all internal teams and contracted vendors onsite or in direct support of the event (e.g., venue, production, security, catering, ticketing/registration, AV/IT).

Audience  
- Event leadership, functional leads, on-call Duty Managers, vendor managers, security, medical, IT/AV, communications, finance, legal/compliance.

Definitions  
- Incident: Any unplanned event that disrupts or may disrupt safe, compliant, on-time delivery.  
- Risk Appetite: The degree of risk accepted in pursuit of event objectives.  
- Severity Level: A standardized scale (1–3) used to determine impact and escalation path.  
- Duty Manager (DM): The designated on-duty coordinator responsible for triage and initial escalations.  
- Incident Commander (IC): The Event Director (or delegate) who leads response for Level 2 and 3 incidents.

---

## Risk Appetite Statement

- Safety & Health: Near-zero tolerance. All life-safety risks must be immediately mitigated or operations paused.  
- Legal/Compliance: Zero tolerance for non-compliance (permits, alcohol service, ADA, data privacy, IP/licensing).  
- Reputation: Low tolerance for negative public sentiment and VIP exposure risks; rapid containment and clear comms required.  
- Operational Continuity: Low-to-moderate tolerance; brief controlled disruptions acceptable if transparent and recoverable.  
- Financial: Moderate tolerance within approved contingency; avoid commitments that exceed pre-approved thresholds.  
- Data/Technology: Low tolerance for data loss or prolonged outage; protected by redundancy and incident SLAs.  
- Vendor/Third-Party: Low tolerance for single points of failure; require backups or substitution plans.

## Severity Levels, Triggers, and Escalation

Severity Levels (SL)  
- Level 1 (Manage): Minor and contained. No safety risk. Single-function impact.  
- Level 2 (Elevate): Material impact to guest experience, schedule, or brand; time-sensitive; multi-function coordination needed.  
- Level 3 (Critical): Life-safety, major legal/compliance exposure, or event-threatening. Requires executive oversight.

Key Triggers by Category (examples include thresholds and time-bound criteria):
- Safety/Health
  - Any medical emergency requiring EMS → SL3 (Immediate)  
  - Crowd density > 4 people/m² sustained for 3 minutes → SL2 (Mitigate within 10 minutes)  
  - Crowd density > 6 people/m² → SL3 (Stop ingress; open egress routes)  
  - Heat Index ≥ 103°F (39.4°C) for 30 minutes → SL2 (Activate heat protocol)  
  - Lightning within 10 miles (16 km) detected → SL3 (Immediate shelter-in-place or hold)  
  - Sustained winds ≥ 35 mph (56 kph) at stage height → SL3 (Cease rigging; clear stage)

- Operational/Technology
  - Ticketing/registration outage > 10 minutes → SL2; > 30 minutes → SL3  
  - Power loss to critical area > 5 minutes with no auto-transfer → SL3  
  - Network latency affecting check-in throughput > 25% for 15 minutes → SL2

- Financial
  - Budget variance forecast > 3% within functional area → SL1  
  - 3–7% variance overall → SL2 (Director approval needed)  
  - > 7% or contingency fully consumed → SL3 (Steering Committee decision)

- Legal/Compliance
  - Permit status at risk of lapse within 5 business days → SL2  
  - Any allegation of non-compliance (alcohol, ADA, licensing) → SL3 (Immediate Legal notify)

- Reputation/Communications
  - Negative sentiment > 20% over 15 minutes during live event or trending negative hashtag → SL2  
  - VIP security/privacy incident (doxxing, threats) → SL3

- Vendor/Third-Party
  - Primary vendor misses critical milestone > 24 hours before go-live with no acceptable workaround → SL2  
  - Day-of-show vendor no-show or strike action → SL3

Escalation Service Levels (acknowledgment and first action)
- SL1: Acknowledge within 15 minutes; first action within 30 minutes.  
- SL2: Acknowledge within 5 minutes; IC engaged within 15 minutes; decision within 30 minutes.  
- SL3: Acknowledge immediately (≤ 2 minutes); IC assumes command; life-safety decisions within 5 minutes; executive notify within 10 minutes.

- Functional Lead: Up to $5,000  
- Event Director (IC): $5,001–$25,000  
- VP, Events: $25,001–$100,000

- Event pause/hold: IC (in consultation with Security/Medical/Production)  
- Event evacuation: IC authority; must notify ESC and venue immediately  
- Public statements: Head of Communications (or delegate) with IC approval; Legal review required for SL3

Contractual/Legal
- Any waiver of standard terms, COIs, or indemnities: Legal must approve  
- Insurance claims or incident notice: Risk Manager initiates; IC informed immediately

Data/Technology
- Temporary downgrade of data protection or security controls: CISO (or delegate) approval required  
- Data breach notification decisions: Legal + CISO + IC + Communications

Backups for Decision Rights
- If the authorized role is unavailable > 5 minutes in SL3 or > 15 minutes in SL2, authority passes to the designated alternate per the contact tree.

## Escalation Flowchart (textual)

Observer detects issue  
→ Is there a life-safety threat (medical emergency, fire, structural risk, lightning within 10 miles)?  
→ If YES:  
  - Call EMS/Venue Security immediately  
  - Notify Duty Manager (DM) by radio/phone  
  - DM notifies Incident Commander (IC) and Security/Medical Leads  
  - IC may order Hold/Pause/Evacuation and activates Comms and Ops  
→ If NO:  
  - DM assesses Severity Level (SL1/SL2/SL3) using triggers  
  - For SL1: Functional Lead mitigates; log incident; DM monitors  
  - For SL2: DM notifies IC; assemble relevant Leads; decide within 30 minutes  
  - For SL3: IC assumes command; notify ESC; execute critical actions within 5–10 minutes  
→ All:  
  - Log in Incident Register; assign owner; communicate status to stakeholders; document decisions and outcomes  
  - After action: Conduct review within 5 business days (SL2/3)

## Key Steps: Incident Management

1) Identify and Triage  
- Anyone can pull the alarm for life-safety.  
- DM assigns a provisional Severity Level using trigger list.  
- Start an Incident Log entry immediately.

2) Stabilize and Secure  
- Safety first: stop unsafe activity, isolate area, coordinate with Security/Medical.  
- For tech issues, execute first-line runbook (e.g., failover to LTE, switch to backup power).

3) Notify According to SL  
- SL1: Inform Functional Lead; update DM; continue monitoring.  
- SL2: DM pages IC; affected Leads join within 10 minutes via radio/hotline/war room.  
- SL3: IC initiates Command Channel; notifies ESC and venue; deploys pre-approved actions.

4) Decide and Act  
- Confirm decision rights holder (Section above).  
- Use Decision Record Template.  
- Timebox: SL2 decisions within 30 minutes; SL3 immediate (≤ 5–10 minutes).

5) Communicate  
- Internal: Ops Channel updates every 10 minutes (SL3) or 30 minutes (SL2) until resolved.  
- External: Communications approves guest messaging; align with Legal for SL3.

6) Document and Close  
- Capture timeline, actions, and outcomes in Incident Log.  
- IC confirms closure criteria met (impact mitigated, stakeholders updated, recovery complete).

7) Review and Improve  
- SL2/3: After Action Review within 5 business days; assign corrective actions; update risk register and playbooks.
