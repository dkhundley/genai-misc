## Overview

This document defines how we source, evaluate, and confirm speakers for our events. It is designed so a new team member can immediately contribute to building a high-quality, diverse, and balanced program.

Assumptions (example event profile you can adjust):
- Event: Annual Product & Innovation Summit
- Dates: November 12–13
- Format: 2 days, 3 concurrent tracks + plenary
- Capacity: 1,000 in-person + livestream
- Session mix: 2 keynotes; 6 plenary talks; 24 breakouts; 6 panels; 7 workshops
- Total speaking slots: 45–50

Success criteria:
- High attendee satisfaction (CSAT ≥ 4.5/5 on content)
- On-time program lock (T-8 weeks)
- Diversity targets met across gender, ethnicity, geography, and role
- Sponsor/content integrity maintained (no sales pitches unless flagged as Sponsored)
- ≥ 90% of sessions recorded and released with clear rights

---

## Key Details and Steps

### 1) Timeline & Milestones (Working Back from Event Day)
- T-28 weeks: Theme finalized; tracks defined; budget per speaker type approved
- T-26 weeks: Sourcing kickoff; Call for Speakers (CFS) draft
- T-24 weeks: CFS live; initial outreach to Tier 1 targets
- T-20 weeks: First shortlist review; screening calls begin
- T-16 weeks: 80% speakers confirmed; contracts in progress
- T-12 weeks: 95% speakers confirmed; session titles/descriptions due
- T-10 weeks: Draft decks/outlines due; rehearsal schedule published
- T-6 weeks: Final decks due; AV tech checks scheduled
- T-2 weeks: Final run of show; speaker briefs distributed
- T+2 weeks: Post-event debrief; ratings compiled; speaker NPS and re-invite list

### 2) Pipeline Coverage Model
Estimate attrition and build sufficient top-of-funnel.
- Target confirmed speakers: 50
- Historical conversion: 25% from first outreach to confirmed
- Recommended top-of-funnel targets:
  - Qualified prospects needed ≈ 200
  - Outreach sends ≈ 320 (assuming 60–65% response rate with reminders)
- Coverage checks:
  - Weekly: Confirmed vs. target by track
  - Weekly: Diversity metrics vs. targets
  - By T-20 weeks: ≥ 2.5x “strong fit” prospects per open slot

### 3) Sourcing Strategy
Use a balanced mix of curated and open sources:
- Expert databases: SpeakerHub, BigSpeak, Women Who Code, Black in AI, Latinx in Tech, Lesbians Who Tech, The Boardlist, All Raise
- Academic and research: Google Scholar, SSRN, ACM/IEEE conference speakers; university press offices
- Industry signals: Authors of top-cited papers; patent holders; maintainers of notable OSS projects; product leaders behind recent launches
- Communities: Relevant Slack/Discord groups; meetup organizers; SIG chairs; Meetup.com; Eventbrite discover
- CFS: Promote across newsletter, LinkedIn, partner associations, sponsors’ networks; provide transparent evaluation criteria
- Referrals: Past top-rated speakers, advisory board, sponsors (with conflict checks), customer champions
- Media & thought leadership: Op-ed contributors; podcast guests with strong engagement; Substack authors
- Diversity-first sourcing: Dedicated pass to source underrepresented voices before finalizing any track

Sourcing best practices:
- Always collect a talk video link (even 3–5 min). If none, request a 3-min sample on the proposed topic.
- Prioritize original case studies and data-backed insights over vendor pitches.

### 4) Diversity & Balance Targets
Track at session and conference levels. Targets (adjust per event/region):
- Gender representation: 50% women and non-binary across total speakers; no all-male panels
- Ethnic/racial diversity (self-reported, non-mandatory): ≥ 35% underrepresented groups overall; ≥ 1 URG speaker per multi-speaker session where feasible
- Geography: ≥ 30% non-local; ≥ 10% outside primary region
- Role seniority mix: 40% senior execs; 40% mid-level/practitioners; 20% emerging leaders
- Industry mix: No single industry > 35% of program
- Accessibility: Ensure at least 10% sessions explicitly incorporate accessibility considerations or inclusive design topics where relevant

Measurement:
- Use the tracker’s self-identification fields (optional) and do not infer sensitive attributes.
- Run weekly dashboard vs. targets. Flag sessions requiring adjustments.

### 5) Evaluation Rubric (Weighted)
Score each candidate 1–5 per criterion. Use behavioral anchors to improve consistency. Weighted average ≥ 3.6 required to advance; ≥ 4.2 for keynote consideration.

Criteria (weight | anchor examples):
- Topic fit to theme (20%)  
  1: Tangential; 3: Moderate alignment; 5: Directly advances key track objectives
- Demonstrated expertise (15%)  
  1: Limited; 3: Solid practitioner; 5: Recognized authority (published, shipped significant work)
- Speaking quality (15%)  
  1: Monotone/no structure; 3: Clear but average; 5: Dynamic, structured, audience-appropriate
- Originality/insight (10%)  
  1: Generic; 3: Some unique points; 5: Novel frameworks/data-backed insights
- Audience value (10%)  
  1: Low applicability; 3: Useful tips; 5: Clear takeaways/tools attendees can use
- Diversity contribution (10%)  
  1: Does not advance balance; 3: Maintains; 5: Meaningfully improves representation or perspective
- Availability/logistics (5%)  
  1: High risk; 3: Tentative; 5: Flexible and committed
- Marketing draw (8%)  
  1: No draw; 3: Niche following; 5: High-profile with engaged audience
- Conflict risk/commercial bias (7%)  
  1: High risk; 3: Manageable; 5: Low risk and transparent
- Format suitability (5%)  
  1: Weak match; 3: Adequate; 5: Excellent for proposed session type

Process:
- Two independent reviewers score; differences > 1.0 trigger calibration
- Keep a short justification (1–3 sentences) per criterion
- Anything < 3 on Conflict risk requires a mitigation plan

### 6) Vetting Process
- Shortlist triage: Confirm basic fit, availability window, budget expectations
- Screening call (20–30 min):
  - Clarify proposed title, 3 learning objectives, intended audience level
  - Request examples: data, case studies, lessons learned
  - Assess speaking dynamics; ask for 3-min sample if needed
  - Confirm disclosure posture (no confidential info; vendor neutrality)
  - Accessibility: confirm comfort with captioning, mic technique, pace considerations
- Reference or content check: Past event orgs, video review, or published work
- Conflict check:
  - Sponsors/competitors on stage policy
  - Jurisdictional compliance, export controls if technical
  - Exclusivity clauses or overlapping event commitments
- Decision:
  - Advance to “Hold” or “Confirm”
  - Or place in “Later” (waitlist) with clear next steps

### 7) Outreach Cadence
Cadence (email first, then LinkedIn if needed):
- Day 0: Initial invite
- Day 3: Bump 1 (forward) with 1-line value reminder
- Day 7: Bump 2 + propose times; optional LinkedIn message
- Day 12: Final bump + request referral if unavailable
- Day 20: Close loop; mark as “No response” and move to archive or referral

Service-level expectations:
- Respond to inbound within 2 business days
- Send calendar hold within 24 hours of verbal interest
- Issue contract within 5 business days of verbal confirm

### 8) Fee & Terms Guidelines
- Standard policy: Industry practitioners (non-celebrity) = honorarium $500–$3,000; Keynotes $5,000–$20,000 based on profile. Academics/NGO may accept travel + honorarium.
- Travel: Economy or premium economy per policy; bookable by our travel desk or reimbursed with receipts; per diem by city tier
- Recording rights: Non-exclusive perpetual license to use talk video; opt-out only with prior approval
- Sponsor neutrality: No product pitches in non-sponsored sessions; declare affiliations
- Substitutions: Allowed with vetting; must meet rubric threshold
- Cancellation: 30-day notice required; force majeure clause included
