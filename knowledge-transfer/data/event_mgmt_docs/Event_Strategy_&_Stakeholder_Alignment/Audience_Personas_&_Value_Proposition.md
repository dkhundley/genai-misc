- Business objectives: Pipeline generation, product adoption/expansion, partner ecosystems, brand leadership.

Outputs you can use immediately:
- Five persona one-pagers with goals, pain points, motivations, barriers, JTBD, and tailored messages.
- A repeatable process and timeline to validate and activate personas.
- A lightweight tagging schema and KPIs to measure persona-level success.
- Templates for persona creation and JTBD writing.

## Key Details and Steps

1) Define target segments and success criteria (T-12 to T-10 weeks)
- Align with Sales, Product, and Customer Success on:
  - Priority audiences for this event cycle
  - Desired commercially-relevant outcomes (e.g., net-new pipeline, expansions, deal acceleration, adoption)
  - Capacity constraints (room sizes, exec 1:1 availability) that impact persona prioritization
- Decide which personas will be primary (programming and budget priority) vs. secondary (targeted comms only).

2) Collect inputs (T-12 to T-9 weeks)
- Quantitative:
  - CRM: historical attendance by role/segment, opportunity stage, ACV, close rates.
  - Website/email analytics: top content by segment (e.g., exec guides vs. hands-on labs).
  - Post-event surveys and NPS: satisfaction by role/function.
- Qualitative:
  - 8–12 stakeholder interviews (Sales, SEs, CSMs, Product Marketing, Support).
  - 10–15 attendee interviews (mix of customers, prospects, partners).
  - Social/community listening: recurring themes and objections.
- Document raw findings in a shared repository; tag by segment and theme.

3) Draft personas and JTBD (T-9 to T-7 weeks)
- Write one-page personas using the template in this doc.
- For each persona, write 2–3 JTBD statements. Example format:
  - When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

4) Validate with stakeholders (T-7 to T-6 weeks)
- Run a 60–90 minute alignment workshop:
  - Review personas, JTBD, and value propositions.
  - Confirm primary/secondary status and KPIs per persona.
  - Capture objections and finalize messaging and offer hooks.

5) Test and refine (T-6 to T-4 weeks)
- Run small A/B email and paid social tests per persona:
  - Measure open, CTR, registration conversion, and reply rates.
- Adjust messaging, channels, and offers based on data.

6) Activate across workstreams (T-4 weeks to event)
- Marketing: build persona-targeted nurture streams, landing pages, and creative.
- Content/Program: map sessions, tracks, and labs to persona needs.
- Sales/CS: provide talk tracks and “convince your manager” kits per persona.
- Ops/Reg: implement persona tags to track funnel and onsite engagement.

7) Post-event validate and iterate (T+1 to T+4 weeks)
- Compare KPIs to targets by persona (registration → attendance → engagement → pipeline/adoption).
- Update personas with new insights; archive learnings for next event.
