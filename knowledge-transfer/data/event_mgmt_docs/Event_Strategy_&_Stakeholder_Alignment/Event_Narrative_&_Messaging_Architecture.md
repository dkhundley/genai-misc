Through product launches, peer proof, and hands-on labs, attendees will leave with a practical blueprint to deliver faster with greater confidence and lower risk.

Theme (External)
- Make Complexity Move

Narrative Spine (Story Arc)
- Opening truth: Software complexity is outpacing team capacity.

Speaker Messaging Guidance
- Do:
  - Lead with a problem your audience feels today.
  - Show, don’t tell—demo or diagram over adjectives.
  - Quantify “before vs after.”
  - Address security and governance without fear mongering.
- Don’t:
  - Announce roadmap beyond approved items.
  - Use unverified stats or customer names without clearance.
  - Read slides; design for speaking (1 idea per slide).
- Slide word count:
  - Keynote: 15–25 words max per slide.
  - Breakout: 30–40 words max; use code/diagrams.
- Accessibility:
  - Min 18pt text; 4.5:1 contrast; provide alt text for images.
- Q&A stance:
  - If asked about competitors, pivot to principles and proof; avoid qualitative claims.

Creative Implications
