The specialist guided the user through troubleshooting steps, including using the password reset option on the login screen, which required the user's email address. However, the user was unsure of the email address they used to set up their account, and attempts to reset the password using different email addresses were unsuccessful. The specialist then offered to send a password reset link to the email address on file, but the link didn't work for the user. The issue was escalated to the advanced support team, who will contact the user to resolve the problem. Despite the challenges, the specialist remained patient and helpful throughout the conversation.\",\n",
