Applies To: All sessions and media assets for [Event Example: Summit 2025]

## Overview
This document defines how we design, name, review, version, and finalize all content assets for the event, including slide decks, videos, graphics, and handouts. It includes:
- A template pack for decks and visual assets
- Slide design and brand standards
- File naming conventions and folder structure
- Review and approval workflow with deadlines
- Quality assurance (QA) checklists
- Media export specifications and accessibility standards

Use this document to ensure all content is on-brand, accessible, technically compatible with production, and ready on time.

## Scope
- Content types: Speaker decks, pre-roll/post-roll videos, session bumpers/stingers, lower thirds, sponsor slides, signage, handouts, social and web thumbnails, transcripts, captions.
- Delivery formats: Live, virtual, and hybrid events.

## Key Steps and Timelines
T = Event Day

1) Plan and Intake (T-10 to T-8 weeks)
- Confirm program grid, session codes, and speaker list.
- Distribute the Template Pack, Style Guide, and submission deadlines to speakers and internal teams.
- Collect initial session abstracts, learning objectives, and speaker bios/photos via Content Intake Form.

2) Draft Development (T-8 to T-6 weeks)
- Speakers submit Draft v0.1 decks using the Master Deck template.
- Content Lead reviews for narrative coherence and session outcomes; Design Lead reviews for brand alignment.
- Provide consolidated feedback within 5 business days.

3) SME and Brand Review (T-6 to T-4 weeks)
- SMEs validate facts, data sources, and claims (v1.0 to v1.1).
- Brand/Legal confirms compliance (logos, trademarks, disclaimers).
- Design refines visuals and accessibility (contrast, font size, alt text).

4) Finalization and Rehearsal (T-3 to T-1 weeks)
- Speaker rehearsal with timed run-through (v1.2).
- Lock content at Content Freeze (72 hours pre-event, v1.3 Final).
- Production converts to Show Files (no animations beyond approved, embedded media checked).

5) Show Prep and Delivery (T-1 week to T day)
- Deliver Show Files to Production/AV with cue sheets and backup formats.
- Load-test on venue and streaming platforms; run technical rehearsal.

6) Post-Event (T+1 to T+14 days)

Example
SUMMIT25_T101_Deck_v1.3_20250412_JD.pptx

Folder Structure
- 01_Templates
- 02_Brand (logos, fonts, icons)
- 03_Working (editable in-progress files)
- 04_Review (files under review)
- 05_Final (approved Final assets)
- 06_ShowFiles (production-ready, tested)
- 07_Archive (post-event lock)
- 08_Submissions (speaker uploads)
- 09_Speakers (bios, headshots, releases)
- 10_Video (pre-rolls, session videos, exports)

Rules
- No spaces in filenames; use underscores.
- One source-of-truth file per asset in 03_Working; duplicates only in 05_Final/06_ShowFiles.
- Do not overwrite older versions; increment version numbers.

## Versioning and Change Control
Version Stages
- v0.x Draft: Speaker development
- v1.0 Internal: Content Lead review
- v1.x SME/Brand: Fact-check and brand/legal revisions
- v1.x Final: Approved for production
- ShowFile: Converted/optimized for playback; no further edits

Changelog
- Maintain a “Changelog” slide at the end of each deck (or a separate CHANGELOG.txt) noting date, editor, and summary of changes.

Locking
- After Content Freeze (T-3 days), only the Production Lead may authorize edits; any approved changes create v1.x+1 and updated Show Files.

## Review and Approval Workflow
Gate 1: Content Review (Content Lead)
- Narrative clarity, outcomes, pacing; adherence to template.

Gate 2: SME Review
- Accuracy, data sources cited, claims validated.

Gate 3: Brand/Legal Review
- Logo usage, partner marks, disclaimers.

Gate 4: Design/Accessibility QA
- Typography, contrast, layout, alt text, animation limits.

Gate 5: Technical QA (Production)
- Resolution, media embedding, playback testing, file integrity.

Gate 6: Speaker Approval
- Final content sign-off; rehearsal complete.

Content Freeze: 72 hours before session start (or earlier for broadcast segments).

Turnaround SLAs
- Each gate returns feedback within 3 business days; consolidated feedback only (no parallel conflicting notes).
- Emergency changes inside freeze window require Program Manager approval.

## Production Handoff
Deliverables to Production (per session)
- Show File deck (PPTX) + PDF backup
- Any embedded media also delivered as standalone files
- Cue sheet with slide numbers, animation cues, video roll-ins
- Lower thirds data (CSV or spreadsheet) and approved graphics
- Captions (SRT) and transcript

Handoff Location and Deadline
- Place in 06_ShowFiles > [SessionCode] by T-2 days, 6:00 PM local time.
- Notify Production Lead via channel #content-ops with asset list and checksums if required.

## Risk Management and Escalation
- Late content: If Draft not received by T-6 weeks, Program Manager escalates to track lead; session may be converted to panel or canceled.
- Non-compliant assets: Design Lead may revise for compliance; time billed to project if external.
- Technical incompatibility: Production Lead can request re-exports; if unavailable, fallback to PDF or local playback.
- Speaker no-shows: Use prerecord or convert to fireside Q&A with host.

## Dependencies and Environment Specs
Venue/Platform Examples
- LED wall native: 3840x1080 (ultrawide); use 1920x1080 center-safe area.
- Confidence monitor: 1920x1080; notes view enabled; no external internet guaranteed.
- Streaming: 1080p30; platform supports H.264 MP4; max 16 Mbps ingest.

Confirm before production:
