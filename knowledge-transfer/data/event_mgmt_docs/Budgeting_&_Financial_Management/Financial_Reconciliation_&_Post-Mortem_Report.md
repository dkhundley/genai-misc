# Financial Reconciliation & Post‑Mortem Report
Budgeting & Financial Management Knowledge Item

Document Title: Financial Reconciliation & Post-Mortem Report  
Purpose: Compare actuals vs. budget, analyze variances, tie out to the general ledger (GL), and document lessons learned and recommendations for future events.  
Audience: Event directors, finance managers, producers, procurement/AP/AR, data analysts, and executive stakeholders.

---

## Overview

This document explains how to produce a complete financial reconciliation and post‑mortem report for an event. It covers:

- What to deliver and when
- Data sources and controls
- Step-by-step reconciliation and variance analysis
- GL tie‑out and closing entries
- Narrative findings, lessons learned, and recommendations

Outcome: A signed, audit‑ready report that aligns to the GL, transparently explains variances to budget, and provides actionable improvements for future events.

---

## Scope

- Event Type: Conferences, trade shows, festivals, or corporate summits
- Accounting Basis: Accrual (default); note cash exceptions if applicable
- Timeframe: From budget baseline lock through final close and archive
- Systems: Accounting ERP/GL, AP/AR, registration/ticketing platform, CRM (sponsorship), merchant processor, payroll/HRIS, expense platform

---

## Deliverables

1. Narrative report summarizing results, variances, and recommendations
2. Actuals vs. Budget analysis with category-level drill-downs
3. GL tie‑out pack (reconciliation schedules, journal entries, and support)
4. Final accruals and adjustments that align actual P&L to true event economics
5. Appendices (data extracts, invoice register, AR aging, headcount audit, contract summaries)
6. Sign‑offs from Event Director and Controller

---

## Timeline (Example)

- T‑30 days: Budget baseline locked (version v1.0) with project code.
- Event days: Track commitments, headcount, and change orders daily.
- T+1 business day: Freeze spend; stop new POs unless approved by Controller.
- T+5: Collect all data sources; post known accruals.
- T+10: Draft #1 of reconciliation and variance analysis.
- T+14: Controller review; post final adjusting entries.
- T+18: Executive review of narrative and recommendations.
- T+21: Final report published and archived.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

- Event Finance Lead (Owner): Orchestrates process, builds analysis, drafts narrative, manages approvals.
- Event Director: Validates assumptions, provides operational context, approves lessons learned and recommendations.
- Accounts Payable (AP): Ensures invoice completeness, PO match, and cut‑off compliance.
- Accounts Receivable (AR): Finalizes sponsorship and exhibitor billing; collects and ages receivables.
- Data Analyst: Extracts data from systems; validates joins and event‑level filters.
- Procurement/Vendor Manager: Confirms contract terms, deliverables met, and change orders.
- Controller: Reviews GL tie‑out, approves journal entries, signs off on final report.
- Legal/Compliance (as needed): Contract exceptions, refund policies, tax and privacy.

---

## Data Sources

- GL/ERP: Project code ledger (e.g., Project “EVT‑2025‑ELEVATE”)
- AP/Expense: Vendor invoices, employee expenses, corporate card feed
- AR/CRM: Sponsorship and exhibitor contracts, invoicing status
- Registration/Ticketing: Ticket sales, discounts, refunds, taxes/fees
- Merchant Processor: Settlements, chargebacks, payout timing
- Payroll/HRIS: Overtime, temps/contractors, burden rates
- Production Systems: AV, staging, F&B consumption, usage logs

Tip: Use a unique project code across all systems to tag transactions.

---

## Step‑by‑Step Process

1) Lock the Budget Baseline
- Confirm the official pre‑event budget (v1.0) with:
  - Revenue categories: Ticketing, Sponsorship, Expo/Booths, Ancillary (workshops), Other
  - Expense categories: Venue, F&B, AV/Production, Marketing, Staffing/Payroll, Travel, Decor/Branding, Swag, Shipping/Drayage, Software/Reg, Contingency
- Store the baseline in the Finance folder with date and version.

2) Collect Actuals
- Extract all event‑coded transactions from GL and subledgers.
- Reconcile merchant settlements to ticketing revenue by batch/date.
- Confirm AP completeness: request missing invoices, receipts, credit memos.
- Pull AR aging for sponsorships/exhibitors and match to contracts and deliverables.
- Freeze expense reports; enforce cut‑off date.

3) GL Tie‑Out & Adjustments
- Match subledger totals to the GL by account and project code.
- Post accruals for goods/services received but not yet invoiced.
- Reclassify deposits/prepaids to expense (e.g., venue deposit).
- Recognize deferred revenue for delivered benefits; hold undelivered benefits as deferred.
- Record reserves: refunds, chargebacks, and doubtful AR where indicated.

4) Variance Analysis
- Compare Actuals vs. Budget at category and subcategory level.
- Calculate:
  - Variance $ = Actual − Budget
  - Variance % = Variance $ ÷ Budget
- Investigate root causes via contracts, usage logs, and rate cards.
- Flag material variances: threshold default is +/- 5% of category or +/- $10,000, whichever is greater.

5) Draft Narrative & Charts
- Summarize performance drivers (pricing, attendance, sponsor mix).
- Highlight 3–5 key positive and 3–5 key negative variances.
- Provide visual summaries (see “Chart Examples” below).
- Connect findings to operational levers and future actions.

6) Controller Review & Final Close
- Review tie‑out pack and JE support.
- Post final JEs; lock the period for the project code.
- Capture sign‑offs (Controller and Event Director).
- Archive report and supporting documentation per retention policy.

## GL Tie‑Out: How‑To and Example

Objective: Ensure the event P&L equals the GL balances by account and project code, with documented support.

1) Build the Crosswalk
- Map event categories to GL accounts:
  - Ticketing Revenue → 40010
  - Sponsorship Revenue → 40020
  - Expo Revenue → 40030
  - Venue Expense → 51010
  - F&B Expense → 51020
  - AV/Production → 51030
  - Marketing → 52010
  - Staffing/Payroll → 53010
  - Travel → 53020
  - Other/Contingency → 59990

2) Reconcile Subledgers to GL
- Ticketing platform gross sales − discounts − refunds − merchant fees = Net revenue; tie to 40010.
- Sponsorship invoices less credit memos = Billed revenue; recognize to 40020 as delivered; undelivered to Deferred Revenue (22010).
- AP invoice register by project code = sum of expense accounts; tie to GL.

3) Record Adjustments (Example JEs)
- Accrue F&B Overages (goods received, invoice pending):
  - Dr 51020 F&B Expense 32,400
  - Cr 21010 Accrued Liabilities 32,400

- Reclass Venue Deposit from Prepaid to Expense (post-event):
  - Dr 51010 Venue Expense 50,000
  - Cr 12020 Prepaid Expenses 50,000

- Recognize Sponsorship Deliverables (move from Deferred):
  - Dr 22010 Deferred Revenue 24,000
  - Cr 40020 Sponsorship Revenue 24,000

- Chargeback Reserve (based on post‑event trend):
  - Dr 61050 Bad Debt/Chargeback Expense 7,500
  - Cr 12030 Chargeback Reserve (contra AR) 7,500

4) Tie‑Out Sign‑Off
- Produce a one‑page checklist:
  - All subledger totals match GL? Yes/No
  - All reconciling items listed with JE references? Yes/No
  - Supporting documents saved in the tie‑out folder? Yes/No
- Controller signs and dates.

## Variance Analysis: Investigation Framework

For each material variance:
- What changed (price, volume, mix, timing)?
- Is the change one‑time, recurring, or structural?
- Which controllable levers explain it (e.g., headcount lock, vendor rates, promo strategy)?
- What decision was made, by whom, and when?
- What would we do differently next time?

Example Explanations
- F&B +$47k (21.4%): Attendance exceeded forecast by 7.5% and late on‑site registrations increased meal counts; plus 8% price increase for premium coffee service not reflected in baseline. Recommendation: Lock final F&B guarantee at T‑7 with 5% overage buffer; require Director sign‑off on premium add‑ons.
- Marketing +$23k (19.2%): CPCs spiked in final 10 days; retargeting budget expanded without formal change order. Recommendation: Add daily cap and auto‑pause at 100% of planned spend unless CFO override.
- AV −$12k (−6.0%): Bundled LED wall removed after stage redesign. Keep negotiated bundle option in future RFPs.

## Controls, Policies, and Cut‑Offs

- Cut‑Off: Expenses incurred by event end date included; new commitments after T+1 require Controller approval.
- Materiality: Explain variances over the threshold (+/− 5% or $10k).
- Documentation: Every JE must have PDF support (invoice, contract, or schedule).
- Segregation of Duties: Prep (Finance Lead), Review (Controller), Approval (Controller and Event Director).
- Change Orders: Written approval required for overspend beyond 2% of category or $5k, whichever lower.
- Retention: Keep reports/support for 7 years or per policy.

---

## Dependencies and Risks

Dependencies
- Merchant settlements received and matched
- All vendor invoices submitted by T+5
- Sponsorship deliverables status confirmed by Sales/Partnerships
- Final headcount and consumption logs from Ops/Venue
- Accounting period open for adjustments until T+14

Key Risks and Mitigations
- Late invoices: Pre-close accrual sweep; vendor reminder at T‑3.
- Data mismatches: Unique project code; reconciliation checklist.
- Unrecognized revenue: Deliverables tracker; defer undelivered benefits.
- Chargebacks/refunds: Reserve policy based on historical rates.
- Tax issues: Verify tax codes for ticketing and state/local taxes.

---

## Practical Checklists

Reconciliation Checklist (Abbreviated)
- Budget baseline locked and saved
- All data extracted with project code filter
- Merchant batches match ticketing net revenue
- AP completeness tested against PO log
- AR aging reviewed; collections plan created
- Accrual entries posted; prepaids reclassed
- Deferred revenue recognized appropriately
- GL equals analysis totals; tie‑out signed

Variance Investigation Checklist
- Quantified variance and % vs. budget
- Volume vs. rate vs. mix breakdown
- Contract and usage evidence attached
- Decision owner and date identified
- Preventative recommendation proposed

---

## Metrics & Formulas

- Variance $ = Actual − Budget
- Variance % = (Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget
- Per‑Capita F&B = Total F&B Spend ÷ Attendee Meals Served
- CAC (event) = Marketing Spend ÷ New Paid Registrations
- Sponsor Yield = Sponsorship Revenue ÷ Number of Sponsors
- Gross Margin = Revenue − Expenses
- Margin % = (Revenue − Expenses) ÷ Revenue

Example Per‑Capita F&B
- Total F&B Actual: $267,000; Meals served: 4,900 → $54.49 per meal (Budget: $45.00)

## Recommendations for Future Budgeting (Based on Example)

- Increase F&B per‑capita budget by 15–20% and add a 5% contingency for premium options.
- Implement marketing spend guardrails with auto‑pause at 100% of plan; require controller approval to exceed.
- Standardize AV contracts with scalable bundles and clear change order pricing.
- Lock headcount at T‑7 with a formal “upsell/overage” protocol and pre‑approved thresholds.
- Advance‑bill 50% of sponsorship by T‑30; require deliverable confirmation checklist before recognizing revenue.
