Document title: Signage, Wayfinding & Branding Plan  
Document description: Comprehensive sign inventory with placements, messaging hierarchy, and production specs. Format: signage matrix, elevations, and installation schedule.

---

## Overview

This plan provides the complete signage, wayfinding, and branding strategy for a medium‑to‑large conference at a convention center. It includes messaging hierarchy, production specifications, a signage matrix (inventory), placement elevations, and an installation schedule to ensure safe, compliant, and consistent attendee navigation and brand presence.

Example event context (for specificity):
- Event: TechForward Summit
- Attendance: 2,000
- Venue: Grand River Convention Center (Halls A–B, Ballroom 1–3, Lobby, Meeting Rooms 101–120)
- Dates: March 10–12 (Move‑in March 8–9; Move‑out March 13)

Success criteria:
- Attendees easily find Registration, Sessions, Expo, and Amenities within 2 minutes of arriving.
- All egress paths, ADA clearances, and venue policies maintained and verified.
- On-time installation with zero safety incidents and zero unapproved placements.

## Key Details

### Messaging Hierarchy & Copy Standards
- Tier 1 (Primary): Event identity and major destinations.
  - Examples: “Registration,” “Expo Hall,” “Keynote Entrance,” “Shuttle Pick‑Up”
  - Typeface: Primary brand sans; minimum letter height 3 in for large lobby signs.
  - Contrast ratio ≥ 70%. Max line length 30–40 characters.
- Tier 2 (Directional): Arrows, room ranges, floor indicators, amenities.
  - Arrow convention: Arrow on the side of the movement (→ right, ← left, ↑ forward, ↓ down). Use single arrow per instruction; stack arrows only when splitting paths.
  - Copy examples: “Rooms 101–110 →”, “Restrooms ←”, “Ballrooms 1–3 ↑”
- Tier 3 (Informational): Policies, schedule highlights, QR codes.
  - Keep to ≤ 2 short sentences or bullets. QR code minimum size 1.25 in wide; test from 6 ft.
- Tier 4 (Branding/Sponsors): Logos/marks supporting but not obstructing wayfinding.
  - Follow sponsor guidelines and do not place within 36 in of any egress sign.

Letter height guideline (readability):  
- 1 in of letter height per 10 ft viewing distance (e.g., 3 in letters for 30 ft).
- Digital signs: Minimum 40 pt for 10 ft, 80 pt for 20 ft viewing distances.

Accessibility:
- Mount centerline of temporaries between 48–60 in AFF when feasible.
- Non‑slip floor graphics compliant with ASTM D2047.
- Use icons for restrooms, elevators, stairs, info; use alt text in digital assets.

Language:
- English primary; consider bilingual overlays (e.g., English/Spanish). Keep bilingual lines separate; English on top unless local standard differs.
